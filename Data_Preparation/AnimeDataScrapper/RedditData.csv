She\xe2\x80\x99s great against massive Kaiju and he\xe2\x80\x99s a small to medium specialist. Her giving him those words of encouragement probably saved his life and career, no wonder he wants to stand next to her.

The level of skill and attention to detail for every strike didn\xe2\x80\x99t go unnoticed. \n\nBut even that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. This felt like a heavyweight fight with both sides just going back and forth. I figured Mina showing up wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be enough to take out Kaiju number 10, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99d go all mutually assured destruction and try to nuke the place. \n\nKafka\xe2\x80\x99s reveal scene was so awesome and very much in character.

beDang0310,"b""This show is fun to watch and the characters are likable enough, but I have got to say that this show so far lacks any sort of stakes whatsoever. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not because no one died or the lighter tone of the show. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need deaths or have a serious tone to create stakes.\n\nBut it almost feels like the author keep avoiding any sort of plot points that could give some of tension and stake to the action and the more serious stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the show.\n\nSo far, the story was written as if it was a sport anime but since it\xe2\x80\x99s not sport anime it kinda doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work:\n\nFor a monster invasion show, the main character\xe2\x80\x99s motivation is such an odd choice. And not only that, the author didn\xe2\x80\x99t even do anything out of the box with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s very basic and shallow.\n\nThe main character got this power that was given to him by a monster, but he got full control over it almost immediately and when he did lose control, it was when he couldn't cause any consequences.\n\nSo far we haven\xe2\x80\x99t met a single character in this show whose life has been heavily affected by the Kaiju, not even civilians.\n\nThe show hasn't shown us how the existence of the kaiju affects society and human life, especially the characters's life. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help that the motivation of most of the characters we know so far is \xe2\x80\x9cMina is so cool\xe2\x80\x9d. Almost nobody has a compelling reason why they take this dangerous job.\n\nWhenever there\xe2\x80\x99s a kaiju invasion, it feels like the characters are participating in some sort of sport but without the competition rather than fighting against a dangerous threat.\xc2\xa0""",Kaijuu 8-gou • Kaiju No. 8 - Episode 11 discussion

Frontier246,"b'Well, pretty ominous note to start on with the Defense Force bigwigs all debating what to do about Kafka...leaning hard into dissecting him and turning him into a weapon. And Kikoru\'s dad wants him in their custody.\n\nIt\'s not a pretty sight seeing Kafka all bound and chained up like that, especially when Mina and Hoshina show up and he can\'t even properly apologize as they lead him away like he\'s on Death Row and walking alongside all the comrades he feels like he either failed or betrayed. But Ichikawa believing he\'ll come back to them isn\'t just his own opinion, the entire Third Division still believes in Kafka as Kafka, not a Kaiju. And they even salute him under the guise of saluting Mina!\n\nAs for Mina herself, she\'s fully committed to getting all the evidence she can to save his life, to prove that he\'s a human and not a threat, because she knew deep down that he was still Kafka. She even calls him ""Kafka-kun"" again. And if only for a moment she lets down the mask of the Defense Force Captain and is just Mina again as she lets Kafka knows she\'ll always be waiting for him.\n\nI love how Hoshina\'s priority in getting Kafka back is a proper rematch with Kaiju No. 8, though he really is just worried about Kafka. \n\nWell, it\'s one thing for his squad to accept Kafka, they knew him and were saved by him numerous times, but what about the brass? Or society? And there\'s really nothing they can do about it.\n\nIt shows how much they care about Kafka that Izumo is willing to get help from his father and Aoi is willing to call in a favor to help him. \n\nThough Kikoru does the one thing SHE can do, which is plead Kafka\'s case to her father, but he does what he always does and just berates her and her failures. Dude seems to have a personal vendetta against Kaiju after what happened to Kikoru\'s mother, and that means bad things for Kafka. But at least Kikoru was able to face him as her father while still believing in Kafka.\n\nThey\'re breaking the team up!? Well, I get the point of seeding the top rookies in other divisions, though Ichikawa probably sees this as another chance to prove himself.\n\nKafka could probably have broken free if he wanted too...but now he has to plead his case to Director Shinomiya, who has no interest in hearing words from a Kaiju and fights Kafka to bring out his Kaiju side. With the power of a Numbers weapon harvested from Kaiju No. 2, he has piledriving gauntlets that can tear through Kafka on the defensive and leaves Kafka little choice but to 100% transform. And Shinomiya succeeded in bringing out the Kaiju in more ways than one as it seems like now the bug in Kafka\'s body is exerting control and trying to turn him into a full Kaiju!

rrrriddikulus,"b'I know everyone is really hype about this show but I can\'t get over my disappointment. It started as a really funny show with some serious moments. It stood out from the pack because it had an older protagonist (in his early 30s instead of high school / university), had good dialog, and an interesting premise. Now it\'s just frustrating to watch.\n\nTo illustrate, let\'s compare for a moment Kaiju #8 E11 against almost exactly the same scenario happening in AoT: when the Survey Corps discovers that Eren is a titan. AoT is by no means perfect, but it\'s such a convenient comparison point due to the similarities of this episode. In AoT, there was a thoughtful discussion about whether to kill Eren or keep him. There was politics and factions. Could he be trusted? Could he keep a semblance of himself when he transformed? There was a field test. They asked questions, ran experiments. In Kaiju, they just go to kill him. Sure, don\'t ask how this happened, when it happened, or whether he can be used. The least curious people in the world are running the JAKDF.\n\nIn addition, Kaiju No 8 has started suffering from Shonen Syndrome (esp. over the past couple of episodes). For example, the guy in charge of an organization is always the most powerful. This is such a dumb trope but you see it in so many shonen anime. By that logic, Jon Jones would be President of the United States. I honestly thought Kaiju was better than that.\n\nThe director\'s motivations are so shallow they\'re cringeworthy. A kaiju killed his wife and now he hates all kaiju unconditionally. He\'s a B-Tier Marvel villain - a guy wearing red killed his wife and now he hunts people wearing red at night. They call him the Red Hunter.\n\nAnd what was his plan? Case 1: Kafka isn\'t really a Kaiju, can keep a semblance of himself, refuses to go full strength against the director, and is murdered for no good reason. They threw him into the water, he sank and drowned, therefore he wasn\'t a witch. Case 2: Kafka has no control over his Kaiju state, or is a kaiju spy. He\'s forced to go full force and murder the director. And now the director is dead. Hooray? Who thought this was a good idea?\n\nAnd of course, the comments will say ""yeah but it\'s anime this happens all the time"". Exactly. Kaiju started as something really special. Now it\'s just Generic Shonen Number 8.'",Kaijuu 8-gou • Kaiju No. 8 - Episode 11 discussion

It's one of the few shounen I've seen, where animation is basically at a flat baseline always. Like usually a shounen will have drawn out, mostly static conversations for exposition, seemingly to gather up resources for one big blow out action scene where the animation quality significantly ramps up. This doesn't do that, and interactions of characters outside of combat are generally animated at the same level of quality as the action scenes, with instead the budget here seemingly saved instead for shots of scale.

Marston_vc,"b'Brother, just go look up \xe2\x80\x9cbest shonen anime\xe2\x80\x9d and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a list of dozens. All these shows are essentially \xe2\x80\x9cmale protag works super duper hard and kicks ass\xe2\x80\x9d and by that criteria we\xe2\x80\x99ve got hundreds of options. Still Dozens if you want the show to be as pretty as those shows you listed. \n\nOff the top of my head: Demon Slayer, Akame Ga Kill, Naruto, bleach, megalo boxing, kill la kill, Gundam iron blooded orphans, code geass, attack on titan, my hero academia, goblin slayer, darling in the FRANXX, and probably any and all sports anime. \n\nAll of the shows I listed are considered pretty good or great and are somewhat similar in spirit to the shows you listed. \n\nIf you want \xe2\x80\x9cmale protag works super duper hard to fight monsters\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend demon slayer, attack on titan, or maybe goblin slayer but that last one is mid compared to the other two. \n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s also old school ones like Berserk or Gantz. Both are classics but they ain\xe2\x80\x99t new.'",Please recommend me some animes like Kaiju no. 8 and solo leveling

Ghoste-Face,"b""Im not surprised about Toho in production. I mean they're literally the home of Godzilla/Kaiju.\n\nI know it's inevitable that it's going to have considering the fact that it's one of the best Shonen Jump+ manga right now along with (Dandadan) and it's winning awards and has 8 million copies in circulation for vols 1-7 without an anime adaptation.\n\nBut the pacing of this manga is kinda slow. Chapters and it's biweekly schedule. It has a very strong start to be honest but ultimately it fall to the bad pacing. Chapter 68 just dropped right now and the author Naoya Matsumoto just also announced he will take a 1 month break.\n\n But nonetheless im very looking forward to this, since Kafka is the second main character in Shonen Jump i know who is not a teenager but an adult. most of all great fight scenes and awesome kaiju transformation art!""","""Kaiju No. 8"" Anime Announced"

redwingz11,"b'I like the manga until the the big bad kaiju antagonist shows up, I dont like him, it feels bullshit, also the fight eats up panel, he likes to do 2 page spread, so fight feels like a slog (anime definetely could fix this). the character is meh for me perhaps because chapter are used for fight scene.

AdmirableFondant0,"b""Toho is on an insane spree. 3 Major successful IP's in 2 years? They must have really good connections at Shueisha.\nKaiju.8 is only second to Spy (surpassed it at first but is now a fair amount behind) in terms of success and sales. It has been selling and charting in France, Italy,US as well,despite little internet WOM (from what i've seen at least) but it seems its becoming more and more common due to the overseas/western market getting much bigger though. However this doesn't seem to be an anime trailer, so it might not get a big announcement boost I guess.\n\nI wonder if they'll push for movies for both Spy & Kaiju. They get 70-80% or more of the revenue from movies since they own major part of the cinema market. I think it's looking likely since Spy moving at a slow pace and don't think they'll adapt much of kaiju either. Although i didn't read much of Kaiju it has 67 chapters, similar to Spy and similar release schedule IIRC.\n\nIt might release late 2023-early-late 2024 at this point? Its weird to announce it without even a studio or an animated visual at least.""","""Kaiju No. 8"" Anime Announced"

Silent_Shadow05,"b'The manga was very cool and an exciting read, atleast at the beginning IMO. It was what you get when you combine OPM with Tokusatsu stuff like Kaijus.\n\nThat aside, the major problem I felt with the manga was the pacing issues. I guess the anime can fix it and maybe add more anime-original scenes to enhance some of the side characters.\n\nAs for the studio, I hope for Bones-Orange collaboration, like what they did with *Godzilla Singular Point*. If they can build up on that, the animation could end up being pretty amazing.'","""Kaiju No. 8"" Anime Announced"
