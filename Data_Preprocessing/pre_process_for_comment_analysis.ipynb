       "'b\\'\\\\n                this is my first review thank you for being indulgent\\\\n\\\\nfirst the scenario of Kimetsu no yaiba has nothing really remarkable it is in the end quite classic without big reversal of situation, nothing that makes him stand out from the lot. Tanjiro\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xe2\\\\x82\\\\xac\\\\xe2\\\\x84\\\\xa2s objective changes from that of the other classic shonen, the goal of our hero being simply to find a way to retransform his sister into a human, (the one or mainly that of the other shonen neketsu is to be the strongest). The anime regularly speaks to us because/thanks to this objective of family relations and confronts several visions of the family with\\\\n                  ...\\\\n          that of the other characters. This is for me what makes Kimetsu no yaiba differentiates itself from other anime, personally I had never seen before a anime talked about family relations this is perhaps why it marked methe characters seem to have a very thorough development, I hope that all the characters will have the right to a development.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNext the graphics of kimetsu no yaiba are very beautiful, (even if one could have thought that ufotable would have done better). The animation is just sublime, (probably one of the most animated anime I have seen). The style is quite clean a kimetsu no yaiba, (despite that this style really looks like that of other ufotable anime). The touch brought to the sword technique really make the whole beautiful (like the zenitsu lightning).\\\\n\\\\nThe seiyuu voices are good, (I didn\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xe2\\\\x82\\\\xac\\\\xe2\\\\x84\\\\xa2t really pay attention). The sound effects are also very good there is not really anything to complain about, the most important point of kimetsu no yaiba is the OST that is just amazing, (the composer being Yuki Kajiura,) all ost are a real pleasure to listen to, (my favorite being the Zen\\\\\\'itsu theme). The only regret for ost is that the one that came out the most is that of the famous episode 19, which is for me far from being the best. The opening is really good (probably one of the only ones I like among those of singer Lisa, the ending is also very cool even if it is less good than the opening.\\\\n\\\\nThe characters are interesting, some already have a good development, to see in the sequel if the others will have one as well, but I do not think that all will have a development. The chara design is really original, the most part are very colorful with colors that I rarely see in other anime (like the yellow of Zen\\\\\\'istu).\\\\n\\\\nWhat I like the most about this anime is really the ost, (Yuki Kajiura being probably my favorite composer it\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xe2\\\\x82\\\\xac\\\\xe2\\\\x84\\\\xa2s pretty logical). The animations are also really sublime (episode 19) the graphic quality is really beautiful, there is no personal that is zero they are all interesting, and brings all something to the anime is contributing to make Kimetsu no yaiba one of my favorite anime (shinobu <3).\\\\nHowever the scenario is not really transcendent, of the story in itself also it is in the final quite classical, the world of kimetsu no yaiba is really cliche, (people who fight with sabres and \"powers\" that make (almost), that fighting really reminds me of my opinion about anime before I start looking at it. (And this image is according to it\\\\\\'s probably in the worst that we can give to anime in my opinion). And this is probably the image that people who do not watch anime have anime\\\\n\\\\nTo conclude Kimetsu no yaiba is not good because the scenario is good, Kimetsu has made talk of him because it is pleasant to watch the animations are probably the best that have seen him for a shonen neketsu the ost are sublime is this is what makes us go into the anime (the animation and the ost allowed me to see the most epic anime I have ever seen)\\\\n              \\''"
