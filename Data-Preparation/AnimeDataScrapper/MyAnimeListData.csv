Roevhaal,"b""\n                Oh boy, the seasonal battle shounen that everyone raves about, what does it do right? Well to be completely honest, nothing, the only thing it got going for it is the production quality from ufotable.\n\nStory: 2 (contains spoilers up to ep 19)\n\nThere's really nothing special here, the series starts out with Tanjirou's family got devouvered by demons and his sister Nezuko got turned into one. In order to save his sister and turn her human again he set out to find Muzan Kibutsuji the original demon who surely has some way of turning Nezuko human again. In order to get to him he needs to\n                  ...\n          be strong and fight a lot of demons thus he becomes a demon slayer. After this set up he just fights demons every episode and honestly it gets tiring fast. They decide to fix this repetitiveness by introducing two other main characters who are extremely obnoxious and later by introducing a spider demon who's several times more powerful than Tanjirou and the demons we've seen prior. However the way they handle this demon is done in the worst way possible, first to showcase how powerful he is when Tanjirou goes to cut his spider thread it is the sword that is cut instead and after getting destroyed by the demon, he has a flashback and pulls out a breathing technique called dance of the fire god from his ass, he then oblitirates his opponent with his sword whose blade is now half the length of the hilt. After this I completely gave up on the series, Fairy Tail has better writing than this.\n\nArt / Animation: 8\n\nThe reason this series got popular in the first place, I have to admit it's beautiful and the fight scenes are fantastic, I do have a minor issue whenever I see CG Tanjirou walking around but it's otherwise fantastic.\n\nSound: 6\n\nThere's really nothing to complain about but there's not much to praise either. The music is solid and gets the job done but it's also unmemorable. The've assambled an absolutely fantastic voice cast but their roles don't alow for them to shine, the only exeptional voice performance is from Saori Hayami as Shinobu.\n\nCharacters: 0\n\nThe absolute worst part of the show, pretty much all the characters are as flat as a piece of cardboard with a single character trait, for many of them this character trait is also extremely obnoxious. Tanjirou is your standard shounen protagonist, overly righteous with a strong sense of comradery, honestly a really boring character that we've all seen a hundred times before so that he still ends up being one of the best characters in the show is speaking volumes about the rest of the cast. Nezuko is cute and that's it, apart from protecting Tanjirou a handful of times she hasn't done anything apart from looking cute she's also one of the better characters in the show. Inosuke is stupid, loud and obnoxious and tries to solve everything by beating stuff up, that's it there's nothing else to his character. Zenitsu is one of the worst characters I've seen in any medium, he's the biggest coward ever and his constant screaming makes you want to tear your hair off. Giyuu seems like a passable character on par with Tanjirou but I haven't found a reason to actually like him. Shinobu would be the most intersting character so far but she appears too robotic in her mission ''demon bad, gotta kill demon''. If she actually listened to Giyuu but still come to the same conclusion I wouldn't have a problem. Also she's a woman so of course she has to be too weak to sever the head of a demon, her sword and poison is cool and all but come on, find a better reason, it's pretty clear that strength is not the key component in severing the head of a demon in this universe. The rest of the pilars hasn't had much screentime but they've made an awful first impression, they've all been shows to have a single exaggerated character trait and nothing else.\n\nEnjoyment: 0\n\nBoring plot with obnoxious characters that drive you insane leads to an absolutely abysmal level of enjoyment on par with staring into a wall while listening to a screaming baby for 10 hours.\n\nOverall: 1\n\nTo me this is the perfect example of style over substance and goes to show that as long as something has flashy fight scenes it's very likely to be loved by the anime community. If you're not already a big battle shounen fan who's able to watch a series for the action sakuga alone stay far away from this series.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Stark700,"b""\n                Ah ufotable, the studio that keeps on giving. Before Kimetsu no Yaiba aired, news broke out that we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d get them animating the show. And to my delight, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a studio that earned its praise for its high caliber animation and consistently delivering quality content. Being their first 2-cour show (without a split cour break), Kimetsu no Yaiba is a special gift not just for the manga fans but anyone ready to experience a world of demons and dark fantasy.\n\nWith over 170 chapters and counting, manga artist Koyoharu Gotouge made this series as a dark fantasy-adventure about demons. With 26 episodes, there are some concerns about\n                  ...\n          how much content we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d actually get adapted. For statistical references, each episode adapts about 3 chapters. Most of the episodes follows these chapters by the letter and to manga fans, I think this is a special treat. Not too manga series follows this trend and some unfortunately decides to jump off the rail and follow its own path. With that being said, Kimetsu no Yaiba is a series that I recommend and there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s plenty reasons to see why.\n\nThe experience of watching this show goes beyond the realm of its visual quality. Ufotabe applied their cinematic style to bring the characters and story to life but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s important to realize what the author wanted to bring from his work. From the start, the show had a vision. It sets up a state of tragedy that deals with life and death. The demons in this show are devices created with the purpose to generate fear, the type of feeling that viewers needs to experience when watching a dark fantasy. Often these days, I find myself feeling bored when watching dark fantasies when it relies too much on relationship developments. Instead, Kimetsu no Yaiba elegantly tells a story that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s straightforward yet meaningful to deliver its premise. We meet main protagonist Tanjiro Kamado, a determined demon slayer who stops at nothing to help find a cure for his sister, Nezuko. The first few episodes establishes their important character relationship as even with Nezuko being a demon, he refuse to kill her. In return, Nezuko uses her own skills to help Tanjiro when he is in trouble fighting demons on his own. Early episodes also shows Tanjiro learning the ropes as a demon slayer. The anime makes it clear about the reality of their world where death is common and can happen in the brink of an eye. If you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t believe me, just take a look at what happens to Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s family. With such a tragic setup, the anime seeks to bring hope for Tanjiro and his journey to make things better for his only remaining family.\n\nIn remembering the past, Kimetsu no Yaiba is known for showing the importance of family. Known for showing rather than telling, it should be easy to see the close relationship Tanjiro has with his sister, mother, and father. Throughout the show, Tanjiro is also known for his duty to eliminate demons although he doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t truly hate all of them. Rather than having a black and white philosophy, he also feels sympathy for some of the demons he faces. However, there is one demon he both fears and despises \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c the mysterious and powerful Kibutsuji Muzan. As the primary antagonist of the show, he is also the catalyst of tragic events in Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s life. Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s face the reality here: he killed Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s family and is responsible in making Nezuko into a demon. How can Tanjiro not hate this demon? As a cold-hearted and manipulative personality, Kibutsuji is one of Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s main obstacles to overcome during this dark fantasy adventure. Unfortunately, we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t get too much inside scoop on Kibutsuji\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s character besides what he shows on the surface. The anime limited itself with adapting his story but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s still shown that he is one, if not the most dangerous antagonist in this show.\n\nWith the premise of demon slaying, there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s plenty of room for other characters to get their own spotlights. Some of the more prominent names include Zenitsu Agatsuma, Inosuke Hashibira, and Genya Shinazugawa. The author made these characters with conflicting personalities to bring more value to their roles. For instance, Zenitsu is initially portrayed as a coward but over time, he conquers his fears and learns to accept his role as a demon slayer. Inosuke is known for his fierce personality and competitive persona. While the show doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t develop his character as much as the others, he brings a unique form of fighting and charisma. And we shouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t forget about Genya since he first appeared in the show. Known for its foul mouth and killing desire, one should wonder how much he can really fit the role as a demon slayer. It helps that Kimetsu no Yaiba features a diverse cast of characters who are all unique on their own. On the other hand, the same principle may not apply entirely for the demons. Truth to be told, most of the demons in the show has a rather one sided personality. Most of them are known for their bloodlust and urge to kill. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a primary factor that can make the demons more forgettable compared to the human characters. Outside of Kibutsuji, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s really hard to say any of these demons are actually worth remembering for this adaptation. If in the future when this gets more animated episodes, they could be worth mentioning.\n\nYet, ufotable is well worth mentioning again for their stellar animation and character work. It seems throughout the show, there isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t one instance where an episode suffered quality. It manages to consistently adapt battle scenes with stylistic and cinematic choreography. Character movements aren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t wasted but instead used to showcase the different fighting styles of the cast. The show also uses a realistic environment of snow and mountains to show the harsh conditions of surviving in the wilderness. The demon designs are made with menacing elements from their aggressive nature to their killing expressions. At the same time, the anime also has room for humor with over the top character emotive performances especially from Zenitsu. Even Tanjiro himself has moments where you can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t easily forget. If there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s something to take away from this show, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s ufotable and the director\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s impressive work. They earned this praise. If you don't believe me, watch episode 19 and see for yourself.\n\nAnd it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not only that either. Music and the soundtrack used in this show creates a thrilling atmosphere. In early episodes, I could feel the show being able to tell its story by its melancholic soundtrack alone. When you take the fact of the cast being able to make the characters into life, it really sends a strong impression. The OP song \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Gurenge\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd by LISA carries a sensational aura with its visual storytelling while the ED theme \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93from the edge\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd contains a feeling of serenity and loneliness. \n\nKimetsu no Yaiba is like a love letter to dark fantasy adventure fans. Based on financial reports, the first week had sold over 11k copies while the manga also enjoys a decent success. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not too often to see this type of series succeed but I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m so glad it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s on this road. With ufotable behind the wheels as its studio, this is no pushover when it comes to technical quality. The characters and storytelling are meaningful to its premise while maintain an aura of mystique. We really need more adaptations like Kimetsu no Yaiba.\n              """,Demon Slayer
The-Observer95,"b'\n                This is your typical Shounen anime but done damn right.\n\nThe story is somewhat new in a sense and character location or setting I would say is also kind of new to me in shounen anime, I am saying this because now days shounen anime always start in a city or suburb areas. Its nice to see this anime start the story from middle of nowhere kind of setting (given this anime takes place in past, its not new but different in my opinion).\n\nThe action scenes are jaw dropping and are something you would rewind the few seconds of that scene to see again. Tanijro as\n                  ...\n          a character is also breath of fresh air in this shounen setting, because he do not have lofty goals like becoming king of pirates or something like that, he just wants to turn his sister back to human form once again and he do not rely on friendship power or activating his fourth gear on or going ssj 3, nope he trains like any other human being to earn his power. Directing on this anime is also fascinating, you can tell that director cut no corner for fight scenes(like one other anime I know, looking at you OPM S2) and he went with full force to animate those gorgeous fight scenes. \n\nThe only tiny bit problem is that occasional use of CG models of characters when they are far in the view or are fast moving, but this use of CG is ten times better than what we got for goblin slayer. When its comes to using CG studio Ufotable is leagues ahead in the competition and it shows here. \n\nThis is only anime I am enjoying, which is doing action scenes right. Give it a try you will enjoy it.\n              '",Demon Slayer
diatehneko,"b'\n                [Spoiler Warning]\n\nI\'m sorry I won\'t be able to review everything, but I\'m at the 7th episode now and I can\'t keep watching. I convinced myself to keep watching just to laugh it out, but the show is so inconsistent and poor that it drove me mad.\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba starts out with the carbon copy shonen ""failproof"" formula. Tragedy that fuels progress for the protagonist. This time, it\'s demons attacking and slaughtering most of his family. In his state of despair upon finding the corpses, our MC Tangerine is coldblooded enough to check whose body is still hot enough to be alive, potentially. he doesn\'t need\n                  ...\n          a second to process everything. Screw that. He picks up his sister, who happens to be that. As he\'s on his way to the village, his sister jumps up, and much to Tangerine\'s surprise, the sister was converted to a demon. After their battle, the sister, Nezuko, hesitates to deliver the finishing blow. So Nezuko still has some consciousness. It fits in with the formula, perfect. Then a Demon Killer arrives at the scene to kill Nezuko. Tangerine stops him with a smart trick since he apparently knows that he can\'t beat the Demon Killer. Smart protagonists are cool, nice. Or so I\'d say, but he actually isn\'t one. \n\nYou see, Tangerine has a few special abilities. One is to be smart only at certain situations. Other times, he\'s not so bright. Another ability of his is the ability to smell. He seems to have a great sense of smell, so great that he can smell out openings in an enemy\'s posture, and visualize it to a line connecting his blade to the enemy. His final ability is to breathe. Yes, breathe. He can breathe to improve his body\'s healing rate, his muscles strength, and his speed.  Oh sorry, I might\'ve disrespected the show here. He doesn\'t JUST breathe. He breathes deeply, so that... *checks notes*...the air reaches all the cells in his body. Yup. Deep breathing, people. It\'s a superpower. \n\nTangerine is also established to be ""empathetic towards demons"". How different! He is able to be empathetic towards them since his sister is also one, wow! Or so I\'d say, but we are able to see that he has no problems slashing a Demon\'s both arms in combat even though he knows that a demon isn\'t killed until he slashes the neck. The demon then talks about how little girls are tasty, and Tangerine also has no problems slashing the demon\'s tongue then. Great empathy! Great job, Mr. Justice!\n\nAnother thing that amazes me is how quickly Tangerine acknowledges that he must slay demons to heal his sister. He must fight powerful demons of nightmares, the beings that he somehow has empathy for even though they killed his entire family, but then again the show said ""fuck go back"" to that empathy. Why doesn\'t he chicken out and just try to look for a way to heal his sister, and then realize that he must be a demon slayer to do so? That is the most normal response. But of course, Tangerine, Mr. Justice, xXxDemonSLayer3169xXx needs to time for such emotional garbage. So much so that when his master tells that he brainwashed Nezuko to hate demons and love humans, he shows no response. Okay, cool. Just brainwash my sister, yeah. \n\nYou sticked this far? Great! Because here\'s a shock, Tangerine actually has a fourth special power: the power to see the undead. He saw, talked to, and trained with his master\'s dead disciples. How cool! Great job, Tangerine! I wonder how the story will cover that up! Here\'s a guess though: Their will was so strong that they had to watch over the next disciple to make sure he didn\'t die to the demon boss of the training arc. I bet 50 Turkish Lira for that. It\'s a dying currency, but whatever.\n\nAnd, that is all that I remember about to talk shit about in Kimetsu no Yaiba. However, the studio did a well job drawing and animating the show. While the soundtrack is sometimes out of place, the drawing is breathtaking. It\'s sometimes CGI-ish in the first few episodes, but following tht is awesome animation with an aesthetic that fits the show\'s time period and aesthetic perfectly, since waves are used a lot in Edo-Meiji Japanese culture.\n\nOverall, the show is extremely poor. The characters are also bland and inconsistent, However you get used to that after trying to keep up with the story, which is also of similar nature. But of course, that is just my opinion. Please watch a few episodes yourself before arriving at a conclusion. Here are my Ratings of everything;\nStory: 3/10\nArt: 8/10\nSound: 6/10\nCharacter: 2/10\nEnjoyment: 6/10\nOverall: 3/10\n              '",Demon Slayer
Tsukihi_Phoenix,"b""\n                I've just watch 6 episodes but I think it's necessary to do a review of this.\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba has a great story. In a nutshell, it's about a guy named Tanjirou with a sister who was the unique survivor to a massacre of a demon to their family but she turned into one and it's Tanjirou's mission find a way to return humanity to his sister. \n\nThe art is really AWESOME, we can see this in every episode with the detailed desing of the characters, the background and landscapes. The draw style is outstanding even in the little bonus at the end of every chapter.\n\nIt\n                  ...\n          has a strong and stunning opening that goes according to the story and an OST which remarks every important scene. The ending is remarkable too.\n\nEvery character have their inner story, Tanjiro and his family and the others with their past.\nI really enjoy every episode of this. Although it sounds exaggerated it makes me feel alive with every sensation it gives to me.\n\nIn overall I give this anime a 10/10 because is perfect in every way. Probably the best of this season.\n\nWatch it! I'm sure you will enjoy it.\n              """,Demon Slayer
literaturenerd,"b'\n                Welp...I\'m late to this party! Time to review the most overrated shonen garbage of the last 5 years! Demon Slayer is an anime that absolutely EVERYONE watched last year. Except for me of course, because I was watching bad hentai to make comedy reviews on the internet! I went in with pretty damn high expectations. As of January 2020, DS is rated one of the best anime of all time on MAL and the #1 anime of all time on Kitsu. I\'m dead serious! The kids on Kitsu truly think that this is the GOAT. Galactic Heroes? Ping Pong? Lain? Ashita no Joe? No! Fuck\n                  ...\n          that shit! Demon Slayer baby!\n\nI went in expecting an action series SO epic that it blows your balls off and shoves them up your ass! I expected the love child of Hellsing Ultimate, Fist of the North Star, and Berserk with maybe some Shigurui and Violence Jack thrown in for good measure! The anime with SO much testosterone that Woody Allen could watch it and go into a Norse Berserker rampage, repeatedly bashing his head against a wall just to calm down!\n\nWhat did I get? A very average shonen that looks pretty but is horribly written. At least RebelPanda tried to warn me about this. I just didn\'t listen. He\'s now made me a sad panda too!\n\nSo, what is Demon Slayer about? They certainly don\'t slay any demons. That\'s just a shitty translation into English. In Japanese the enemies are called Oni, but they\'re actually vampires. They\'re undead, fanged humans with vampire powers that can transform other humans by biting them and are immortal unless exposed to sunlight or decapitated with a holy weapon. They\'re fucking vampires! I\'m going to call them that for the rest of this review.\n\nThe story starts off as shonen as possible. The main character is named Tanjiro and he\'s a young coal miner/charcoal merchant from a small, mountain village. At least he\'s a country bumkin, so he\'s not in middle school! One day, an old man randomly warns him that vampires exist! Later that night, his family are slaughtered by vampires. The old man wasn\'t a vampire BTW, that was pure coincidence because this show is horribly written. However, Tanjiro\'s adorable little sister Nezuko has survived and turned into a vampire! A vampire hunter immediately shows up to kill Nezuko, but Tanjiro fights against him and desperately tries to save her. While all other vampires immediately turn evil, Nezuko is able to avoid killing her brother and retains her goodness because the power of love. The vampire hunter is very impressed by the strong bond between these siblings, so he spares Nezuko and sends Tanjiro off to train under an incredibly generic kung fu master and become a vampire hunter.\n\nAs you would expect, Pai Mei is a hard bastard and puts Tanjiro through the wringer. He trains for a year and gains superhuman strength, speed, and techniques because this is a shonen. Now it\'s time for the vampire hunter test! The final exam involves surviving for days against hordes of high-level vampires. The test is so EXTREME and BADASS, that only 2 people have survived it in the last 50 years! The vampire hunter test has killed over 100 potential vampire hunters and thus has actually produced more vampires than hunters. Now that\'s what I call efficiency! Tanjiro survives of course because he\'s the main character and that gives him the power of plot armor!\n\nLet\'s stop the plot summary and talk about world building. Something that Demon Slayer forgot to do. I mentioned this in my review of Shiki, but vampires are fucking bullshit! In most vampire fiction, they\'re immortal and it takes 50 villagers with luck on their side to take down a vampire. The vampires can turn other people into vampires and increase their population exponentially, but somehow there aren\'t that many vampires and normal people don\'t believe in them. There\'s an amazing scene in the Witcher novels in which the comic relief bard talks to a vampire about how they reproduce. The vampire replies, ""Of course we can\'t bite other people and turn them into vampires! Do you comprehend basic math? Let\'s assume a founding population of just 1,000 vampires that came into existence 500 years ago. Each vampire attacks remote villages and kills only 1 peasant per month. Just 20 percent of those bitten turn into vampires. At the end of the first year, there are just under 2400 vampires assuming a couple fucked up and got killed. At the end of year 5 there are 79,000 vampires. After 500 years, do you really think that vampires would be so rare that you\'ve never seen one?!""\n\nThe only way for humans to stand a prayer against vampires would be to design a highly effective weapon that\'s mass produced to the point that everyone has one and can use it. How about a crossbow that shoots blessed silver bolts? In Demon Slayer, the only thing stopping vampires is the guild of vampire hunters, who designed a test so EXTREME that there are 10-15 vampire hunters at any one time and that\'s being very generous. In order for the vampires to not overrun Japan, Tanjiro must be putting up INSANE kill numbers. We\'re talking Soviet state executioner Vasily Blokhin numbers. 7,000 vampires a week! His life is eating, shitting, and killing vampires on an assembly line! In season 2, we\'re going to be introduced to 3 vampire hunters that by themselves have somehow been running Vampire Treblinka in the middle of Tokyo! Jesus, that rant got dark. I apologize for that highly offensive joke, but I just hate this show so much!\n\nNext, we\'re introduced to some annoying side characters that add nothing and piss me off. We do get some cool fight scenes though and Tanjiro carries Nezuko around in a basket as an homage to the 1982 B-movie Basket Case. I just wish it had referenced the Toxic Avenger instead. I\'m more of Toxie guy!\n\nThe art and animation is the only reason this show got a 5 and not a 3 or 4. Demon Slayer followed the My Hero Academia formula to make shonen great again. Rule #1 No filler  #2 Fuck character development. Just have non-stop action! #3 SAKUGA!!! MOAR SAKUGA!!!!\n\nThe music was a huge letdown for me. An action scene for me lives or dies by its music. If you want to have non-stop ass kicking, you better have a pulse pounding, AMAZING OST. Demon Slayer got the composer of Idol Master and 1/10th of the Tekken 5 OST. What\'s wrong with you Ufotable?! You\'re based out of Japan! You could have hired Michiru Yamane, the goddess who wrote all the awesome Castlevania music over her 30 year career at Konami! She made a whole career out of orgasmic, badass music about beating the fuck out of vampires! Even I would probably give this series a 7 if Yamane had been given the OST. Instead, I\'m left having to deliver the sad report that the climactic battle scene from Season 2 of Netflix Castlevania was better than any single scene in Demon Slayer. Yes, the Netflix Americanime with that obnoxious Indian director who said he comes from the future. That show is better than Demon Slayer! Because Bloody Tears!\n\nSo in conclusion, if you enjoyed Vampire Slayer...that\'s cool with me! It just wasn\'t my cup of tea, but I\'m glad other people had fun with it. Those guys on Kitsu sure are overly generous though! If they loved Demon Slayer so much, I can\'t wait to read the praise they wrote about my favorite anime!\n\n(Browses Kitsu) Let\'s see here...series rank 1,983rd. The top rated review by a longshot simply reads: ""u might enjoy this if u re a stupid, horny 12 y/o. LOL!"" \n\n(channels George Costanza rage) "" You know we\'re living IN A SOCIETY! WE\'RE SUPPOSED TO ACT IN A CIVILIZED WAY!""\n\nI think this is the last time I ever browse Kitsu.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Karhu,"b'\n                Only cynical criticism can save us from the gooey sentimentality and naivete, but sometimes rarely a series too precious to deserve this treatment appears, offering nothing but genuine entertainment to a point where its own shortcomings start to seem very insignificant compared to its strongest merits. I may have a soft spot in my heart for this series, but all the things I found to be problematic within the work are still covered here in this review and explained why I think they can be forgiven, because even with all of its problems, this is -in its own way- one of the greatest series seen\n                  ...\n          in the era of modern anime.\n\nThe story itself is nothing to write home about. Boy experiences a dramatic event which entirely rewrites his life, after which he starts walking this path that is the combination of ongoing rescue arc and revenge tale. I wrote this sentence in about 6 seconds, and I assume the writer did his version in the same time. If you remove the script, what is left is quite an awful idea on paper. Had the show been done by any other studio, it\'d have great potential to be unwatchable. But it\'s made by ufotable. And they remind us of one of the basic philosophies of anime that goes as follows: Anime is exactly as good as its execution. Which, in this case, is something that very accurate matches the definition of ""epic"". This is one of the rare series where the obscure statement ""doing it right"" can have universal meaning, because from artistic point of view, there is not much room for different interpretations.\n\nA lot can be said about the animation and art, but perhaps the most essential part is how immersive they are. The visual style can be absorbed to such extent that there is no room for multitasking or side-tracking. Every frame is like a painting, and every sequence and scene delivers because they have been polished beyond belief. Due to this, the series deserves 100% of its viewer\'s attention. This is the type of content that makes it hard to look away from the tv screen, because if you do, you\'re likely to miss something amazing. Overall, the quality combines things from 3 highest peaks of anime art. From it\'s color scheme and art design, Yaiba, at its best, can be compared to Katanagatari (which, I personally consider to be the highest peak of raw art in anime, and I don\'t compare anything to it lightly). From its fluid animation during action scenes, it\'s not far from the best of the best AKA One Punch Man. And from the small/even subtle details, its level of polish comes close to Mahou Tsukai no Yome. Seeing all of these combined and come to life inside a series that follows the classic shonen formula and maintains its quality for two continuous cours is something I never expected from this industry: it\'s simply not realistic to await something this outstanding/this beautiful to come, and because of this, the series is not less than a masterpiece from its artistic side - and becomes one of the rare must watch titles from 2019 for this reason alone.\n\nYaiba\'s music and the use of the music in action scenes is simply stunning. I wouldn\'t change really anything from this department. OST choices are uncommon, yet efficient and highly fitting. Among the better things from this department is not really even how good the songs sound as standalone pieces, but how well and to what extent they are used in the series. Sound mixing stands out because the job is done in such respectable manner; beats play loudly, adding to the tension and atmosphere, and further serving the immersive effect and making the series captivating. OP and ED are praise-worthy as well. As a person who owns LiSA\'s entire discography, I cannot be but pleased to hear her twice in almost every episode. They have been setting me in the right mood/mindset and fixing it before/in-between each episode (I marathoned this series in 2 sections instead of watching it weekly). I don\'t think voice acting really deserves an analysis here because the seiyuu industry is very tight and talent is consistent there, so I will just say that seiyuu choices have been smart. Most of the time the voice goes well together with the character in question, maintaining a certain harmony where the person behind the character does not stand out but, rather, fits in.\n\nTo sum up the production: Yaiba is among the highest peaks of audiovisual achievements in anime, but it doesn\'t only have godly production values: it also never falls into doing compromises. Moreover, anime, as a medium, has widely entered the zone of advertisement platform where original works are becoming scarce and ultimately adaptations based on manga are just a side product of the original. But Yaiba itself is an improvement over its sauce, and for this reason it has all the rights to exist and is deserving most of the praise it gets. This is very clearly a work driven by passion and love for the animated medium, and that makes all the difference in the world.\n\nOur cast itself doesn\'t do anything too great at any point. Their charm really lies within what they don\'t do instead. In every way, the cast is non typical for a series that follows classic shonen format. Tanjirou, our main lead, is a kind soul whose lawful ""good guy traits"" are not pushed to the realism of annoying moral soldier but limited so that it only happens to a respectable, genuine extent. This dude has some chill in him, but also totally different, down-to-earth type of serious side of him exists and it can best be seen in forms of the strong bonds he has for his own sister and the friends he makes along the run. What makes following his adventure and role as the main lead so pleasant and different from the usual is his inner balance which makes scenes that resolve around him appear rather neutral, keeping the focus in the events and visual art instead of being affected by Tanjirou\'s personal ideals. In many ways, he seems like a nameless video game main character thru to whom the viewer (player) experiences the series (game). I found this type of character approach to offer incredible entertainment value in Yaiba\'s case, because the series can be its raw self instead of being a reflection of the so called ""heart"" that many shonen series are famous for.\n\nFor readable length, I will not go in depth with the other cast members, but I have found none of them annoying. Zenitsu is kind of a fujoshi bait, a real cowards and a whine even, but the way he acts out/how his personality is delivered made him my 2nd favorite character in the series. Inosuke (the boar head dude) is what Kacchan from Hero Academia should have been. Nezuko (the sister person) is just criminally cute. What I really appreciate about her is how her entire character -with its traits, behavior and personality- is told visually. Let me repeat what I already said: It\'s all about the execution, and it even makes the characters come alive. To briefly also cover the villains: after the beginning, lots of planning has been put into them. Not all are super memorable, but some still will be bound to be used as an example of good design by me in the future. Outside very few expectations, all of them were still enjoyable to follow in the given moment.\n\nSince Yaiba\'s writing itself is not super stellar, to put it lightly, the next two paragraphs  will be covering some of its major problems as promised, and commenting on to what extent they are a problem and how&why they can be forgiven.\n\nThe first impression is incredibly bad and off putting; The first 5 episodes are hideous, the build up phase literally sucks, the prologue should\'ve been a backstory narration at later point in time, how the story starts rolling onward rises more questions than answers, episodes 6-7 are still subpar. The start is slow and very far from impressive, the story kinda just has to exist for the events to play out, otherwise it\'s highly meaningless. The main character has a superpower that works as a deus ex machina thru the first cour. The comedic reliefs and strong personalities of the assisting main cast can appear impossible to tolerate for some viewers. There is a long list of reasons to not find this show as enjoyable as I did, but even when acknowledging these issues, I don\'t think any of them are severe enough to actually make this anime any less than great. The beginning is hard to forgive, but most of the other stuff not. After the start, the author clearly does not even attempt writing a solid main plot for the series, but instead utterly focuses on polishing these fight scenes and his characters, which essentially are the entire point of the series, writing-wise. When the series so heavily centers around them while the main story itself is a secondary factor, it doesn\'t become hard to actually appreciate the things that are mastered here instead of complaining about things which are besides the point when taking in consideration the bigger picture and the approach of the show. The assisting lead characters are more preference based question, but even comedic reliefs centering around these personas are more of the sort that come from within the characters, being part of their genuine personality instead of purely existing as an attempt to make the audience chance their mood/laugh, which so many similar series fail to do in genuine/believable manner. In this case, I didn\'t have any problems with the approach of the comedic scenes due to this reason. I could complain that some of them are unnecessary, but they still were not badly made.\n\nThe directing itself is a mixed back and inconsistent at times. It\'s like there is a respectable concept, but no solid means or ideas on how to deliver it, so they just kinda throw it in there without any type of build up and hope that the visuals will do the rest/carry it. For example, almost every single character introduction is just a teleportation. Dude/girl/monster appears from nowhere and be like sup. Then they fight or have a chat. That\'s it. There is very little vision and continuity to be seen, in fact, there is almost no content prior the main event (fight) at all. Another poor thing the series uses specially in the beginning are cheap devices that exist in purpose of adjusting the story or lead it to preferred direction. Literally NPC\'s appear and lead the way. They try to give an explanation, but it don\'t even matter, because the explanation could as well be ""literally NPC\'s"" and it wouldn\'t make a difference. These may seem like small things, but this is how the entirety of the story is constructed, developed and moved onward. It\'s simply not very solid way to lead the story and needs to be taken into consideration. Action-wise, the flow is splendid thanks to this very same attribute covered above, but story-wise, these events are based on coincidences, and that level of writing surely doesn\'t get my appreciation. As was already said: It\'s clear that the series doesn\'t even try to offer a substantial story where these events would be standing on more solid ground, and I do have to say that when there is no attempt, it cannot really be seen as a fail either. For example [[coincidence-based story events]], our mc literally just runs into a forest and meets people and monster because, for some reason, all of them are dwelling in the same place. Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure gives a magnificent explanation why this happens in its story; stand users attach each others, and at the same time, there is always a possession of something physical or even mental (knowledge) that is of interest and therefore gives legit explanation why randoms meet each others in this manner. You can call it bs and not buy the explanation, but it still makes perfect sense and follows the series\' own inner logic. Here it\'s like a bar gag. ""Soo, you come here often?""\n\nThese complains are something that I hanged onto during the worst parts (in the beginning, specifically), but after that, the series became pure art and entered the zone of genuine entertainment, having little to no annoying problems at all in the later episodes. In short: Kimetsu no Yaiba is not a flawless anime that\'s based on flawless writing, but it is pretty damn close to flawless art and flawless execution of its own flawed story. While appreciating imperfections may be a hard task, it\'s not hard at all to enjoy Yaiba for the few things which it does so incredibly well, especially when those are its main event. Now I hope that 122 episodes later, this can have its place as the 2nd best shonen anime. As a final verdict: No matter what you think of shonen anime in generally, I highly recommend giving this series a go, because Yaiba is not just a shonen done right, it\'s an anime done right: Art done right.\n              '",Demon Slayer
HanAsparux,"b'\n                I don\'t usually write any reviews for anime, cause it doesn\'t really matter to me that much to share what I saw, but this time I am making an exception. \n\nDemon Slayer starts off semi-generic as a story, but is executed well, and that\'s sort of what I care about. I don\'t look for the most original things, just any story that is executed well and enjoyable to watch. And at first it\'s doing a pretty good job. You usually need time to get used to the setting and see if the story itself will start picking up speed as it goes. But around episode\n                  ...\n          10, the whole show gets ruined. To me, it is absolutely ruined, after watching the next episodes and i\'ll explain why.\n\nUp until that episode, there was just a bit of humour that wasn\'t great, but whatever, put some to be a bit lighter even though it wasn\'t required. Then one of the first side characters is introduced - Yushirou, who is the type I quite despise - the type that always has to butt in because he ""loves"" a certain character and needs to assert his annoying behavior over others, because they wanted to show affection towards that character as well. And it\'s not once, so that we get it - it is every.DAMN.TIME. It just kills the story, kills the pacing and while you have an awesome combat, you have to deal with that crap. But whatever, side character, he\'ll be gone soon.\n\nBut then.........two ""main"" characters appear that pretty much made sure I won\'t continue watching the show. Because I know they won\'t change. You have the absolute pantsy Zenitsu and the absolute block-head Inosuke. \nZenitsu is terrible. He kills the shows. I am not joking. He literally killed the show for me, because all he does is cry, weep, comment in fear on everything that happens and just doesn\'t shut up. I don\'t understand how the writer could have written such a poor character - he\'s not funny. He\'s just not. He\'s like Usopp and Sanji combined, but just their most annoying parts. And he goes on, and on, and on - and I know it won\'t change, because it\'s shonen. And shonen characters do not change much. This character kills the setting and the mood completely. \n\nAnd the other one, Inosuke, is the same caliber of annoyance - only he just keeps screaming how he\'ll beat the shit out of everyone every. DAMN.TIME. With regards of this character archtype, I feel that maybe Bakugo from MHA is the best example, because at least he has some aura to him and intelligence. Bakugo keeps quiet and doesn\'t want to deal with the crap of others. But this guy keeps butting in and again kills the setting, which in this show is pretty damn important!! \n\nSo yeah, I had to do this, because I am tired of shows being destroyed by poor written characters and no story can save them, if I have to listen to 10 minutes of a guy screaming and weeping everytime. As far as the main character, he\'s alright, he might change over the show in some interesting ways, but not those two. Anyone giving this show more than a 7...I don\'t understand how they can stand for those characters. I know I sound harsh, but I feel like one has to be speak up in cases where you feel how something with a lot of potential can be ruined by something that could have easily been avoided or developed better. As far as the story goes, it really has a lot of potential to grow in areas I can\'t imagine and that\'s what makes it really strong.\n              '",Demon Slayer

While the former shortcoming can be overlooked due to the exhilarating, well executed plot points, the latter cannot.  \n\nTanjirou Kamado, a trained Demon Hunter set to hunt down the\n                  ...\n          Demon who murdered his family, is a self-insert protagonist who is tediously prosaic.  Thus far, his only known traits is his determination, his protective nature of his younger sister, and his good natured spirit.  These character qualities can be seen in any number of action-oriented shows, and given the unfortunate circumstance of Nezuko Kamado (Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s sister), her character will probably be relegated to an \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xcb\x9cunforeseen\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 plot twist to stymie Tanjirou in his quest.

Porukana,"b'\n                HOLY SHRIMP THIS ANIME IS GOOD.\n\nTo be completely honest, even though this anime has been doing really well, I still think its under-rated. Let\'s break down the quality of each aspect of the show shall we? I\'ll keep this relatively short and summarize the quality of each aspect without spoiling anything!\n\nStory (10/10) : Not only is this anime setting and story line a relatively unique idea, it\'s also paced masterfully. Some may say the beginning is slightly slow, but if you continue to watch past those parts, it only adds to the experience. It allows you to understand what all those slow paced parts were\n                  ...\n          building up to. The story also has a deep meaning, each encounter, showing the story and reason behind the demon\'s life and existence. This is one of the few shows which makes me actually pity the villainous race, and at the same time wish for their epic deaths.\n\nArt and Animation (9999/10) : Holy crap is the art and animation NEXT LEVEL. Demon Slayer has a relatively unique style of art, especially compared to modern anime. The art style was taken directly from the manga, and transformed into something beautiful. The CGI in this show is also the best I\'ve seen, not only are the effects top tier, the CGI and frame by frame animation quality is absolutely breath taking. I swear you\'ll jump out of your seat, screaming ""LET\'S F***ING GO TANJIRO"" As he spins a water sword animated with perfection, chopping off the heads of demons.\n\nSound and Music (10/10) : The sound in this show is the exact model that every single shounen show should have. The effects, ambient sound, all merge seamlessly with the smooth animation. The music effectively hypes you up or change your mood when necessary, AND BOY IS THE MUSIC TRACK AT THE END OF EPISODE 19 SICK, HOLY FU...\n\nCharacter (10/10) : While reading the manga previous to watching the anime, I really did not like the characters and the character development phases. Each character had a troupe personality, and were relatively cringe to read. Though the anime surprised me, it changed the characters personality into something that was either funny, exciting, or just generally interesting. The character development was outstanding, and at some parts were really emotional and touching.\n\nEnjoyment (9/10) : Although I loved the show, and think it\'s a masterpiece, I just don\'t really have a deep connection with it. Sure each week i\'d be eager and stay up till 12am to watch the latest episode air, but I just don\'t have the same attachment to the anime as I do with some of my other favorite shows. That being said, everything was done to perfection in my opinion, and there is just one small aspect which I have overlooked which might\'ve made this show not as good as it can be.\n\nOverall (10/10)\nWATCH IT, HOLY CRAP THIS IS THE BEST SHOW THIS SEASON\n              '",Demon Slayer
SingleH,"b""\n                Maybe it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just because I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve gone old and crotchety, but I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been really disappointed with ufotable lately. Maybe even that is too harsh. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve just felt so out of touch with them for the past three and a half to four years since they seem to have completely abandoned their old selves. Whether it be the astronomical success of the Fate/Grand Order mobile game, or the fair success of their own Tales of Symphonia OVA BD sales, ufotable has apparently honed in on game adaptations. All they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve made for TV following their 2014 re-adaptation of Studio Deen\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, has\n                  ...\n          been game\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0adaptations. God Eater, Tales of Zestiria the Cross, and Katsugeki/Touken Ranbu, with their only projects outside of TV animation being limited to even more Fate. The ONA series, Today's Menu for the Emiya Family, and the film trilogy, Fate/Stay Night: Heaven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Feel. It just feels like it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s been so long since I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve seen them put their phenomenal production values towards something other than a glorified advertisement for some game I have no interest in whatsoever. When I heard they were adapting Demon Slayer last year, I was excited for two reasons. For one, the manga itself had been selling big-time on its own rights and was extremely hyped up, and more importantly, because it was finally something I could latch onto as a real, self-contained, genuine story. However, I naively forgot a story itself has to be good enough to latch onto in the first place, no matter whose adapting it into animation.\n\nIf I had to describe Demon Slayer in one word, it would be \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93expected.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd Best seller in Shounen Jump? Okay, well it probably has a really bland main character for all the young boys to project themselves onto. Chapters are released weekly? Okay, well the narrative is probably really slow to give the author time to draw it consistently, with overwhelmingly drawn-out action scenes to keep the kids and teens engaged. Author is new to the industry? Okay, well then I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m sure it sells on stellar art design alone, much like its contemporaries who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s visuals obfuscate their aimless writing and vapid theming. I could keep rattling off my judgmental criticism all day, but the point is, no matter how crude I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m being, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not wrong. The main character Tanjiro is, indeed, an uninspired and unopinionated self-insert; the narrative is painfully slow, plodding, and directionless, but not in a way which comes across as intriguing or mysterious at all, just boring; the screenwriting can be frankly incompetent at times, like the time it followed up a scene of the main villain graphically murdering a young girl with a scene of Tanjiro boisterously bickering with a street chef about the unreasonable price of his udon bowls; and while the artwork is extremely unique, well-drawn, beautifully colored, and honestly just pretty to look at, the character writing is brain-numbingly insipid and archetypical. Any assumption you could\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve made about its source material translates identically to the adaptation, and while I mean that for both positive and negative points, the negative is quite pronounced.\n\nHowever, if the show\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s blowout success didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t make it obvious, the positives are very easy to boast, since the issues with this show\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dmuch like the issues with any pop-media bestseller which relies on the patronage of the disproportionally large casual masses\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dare all hidden under the surface, and while it doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t take much thought to peel back the layers and see the emptiness inside, it takes even less thought to just sit back, relax, grab yourself some popcorn, and indulge in the mindless spectacle before your eyes. The action sakuga is outstanding, with the likes of Go Kimura, Masayuki Kunihiro, Mitsuru Obunai, and any other ufotable veteran you can name going all out with their ever-impressive animation extravaganza, and the studio even outsourced some even greater talent in a few godly freelancers like Nozomu Abe to deliver on easily the best cuts of the entire season. And I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t just mean the best cuts of Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s first season, I mean the best cuts of all concurrently airing anime running alongside it. The artwork is utterly gorgeous and fit with the same sharp, crisply digital, deep color design which ufotable has come to define their aesthetic with, only now with the most unique and attractive character designs and downright badass costume design they may\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve ever had the privilege to work with. Set in a magical take on feudal Japan, everyone wears these beautiful kimonos and yukatas with their own characteristic patchwork designs which take complete advantage of the phenomenal coloration aforementioned, and it all looks wonderful.\n\nOutside of action, the characters are unapologetically switched with CG models in tracking shots, and inside the action, the backgrounds are all 3DCG and frankly fail to copy the camerawork of WIT Studio\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dwhich they were obviously attempting to do\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dbut the animation overtop was always bombastic enough to distract its desired casual audience from the cost-cutting, so taking issue with it is pointless. The voice acting was competent, with the exception of Hiro Shimono\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s ear piercing performance as Zenitsu which sounds nothing like his best of work, and the sound design was at least existent, which is a hell of a lot more than you can say about most of its genre contemporaries who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve realized how lazy they can be with their young audiences who couldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t care less about quality sound design. But speaking of the soundscape, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s time to stop bitching and start gushing, because I must complement the one person behind the production who outshone everyone else on staff despite said staff already bringing their all, the composer who I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m sure many of you love with all your heart even if you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t know her name, Yuki Kajiura. If the name doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t ring a bell, you still probably know her from her iconic gothic soundtracks for some of the most famous anime of the last decade, from Fate/Zero to Magical Girl Madoka\xc3\xa2\xcb\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6Magica, and while her work on Demon Slayer was a collaboration with Go Sh\xc3\x84\xc2\xabna, the combination of his brass with her strings was a match made in heaven. Kajiura was a prodigy to begin with and has only continued as a full fledged musical genius for the past decade, and she and Sh\xc3\x84\xc2\xabna made this show so much more than it could\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been, even with its already full staff of talent.\n\nSince Demon Slayer supplants its intellectual emptiness with tireless action sequences, she had more than enough room to work as many high-tempo tracks as she wanted, and they all fit their scenes like a glove. For BGM, she went a direction she hasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t gone since .hack//Sign (if a little less experimental) and integrated traditional Japanese melodies and chants which complemented the feudal setting magnificently. Sh\xc3\x84\xc2\xabna has made some solid music before working with Ghost Oracle Drive and their insert songs in God Eater, but the insert songs he pulled off in collaboration with Kajiura are seriously something to behold, because everything I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve discussed up until this point is all factored back in to the visual spectacle to breathtaking effect. The beautiful artwork is made utterly bewitching by the action wherein the characters\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 designs and color aesthetics are artistically incorporated into their fighting styles in the most visually memorable ways imaginable, like Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s bright blue scarf flowing off his neck like waves only to be enveloped in the tangible waves flowing out of his blade or his best friend\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s striking yellow yukata lighting the entire screen up like fireworks in combat when he himself becomes a raving bolt of lightning. The 3DCG environments are shaky, and the action is what carries this otherwise innocuous show, but I personally found the meandering to sometimes be just as engaging as the show\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s biggest and best flair thanks to the god tier hand-drawn background art from the art director who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s work with ufotable was so renowned, Production IG themselves reached out to have him do the backgrounds for Psycho-Pass, the highest budget and most ambitious TV animation production of the 2010s.\n\nBut I need to make clear the fact this review sounds overwhelmingly positive only because applying critique to something so vacuous is a brief process. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s boring, even if someone as seasoned and jaded as myself did manage to find some semblance of entertainment in the experience. I mean, its TV rating was R15, so it gets to be super edgy. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s this one episode where he fights these two guys underwater and shreds them to pieces like they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re in a blender, so I guess that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s pretty fun. The show got a couple of good laughs out of me, if only for the sheer ridiculousness of the silly gore like that time this guy\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s head popped like a ballon when he got hit with this weird CG volleyball. But that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s all the personality I have for you.

fitemeillreku,"b'\n                This is going to be a shorter review compared to some other ones that I\'ve written since I didn\'t write this one in advance as compared to my other two reviews, so this is probably much more disorganized but nevertheless, I wanted to share my opinion on this so far.\n\nStory - 8/10\nThe story starts off with our main protagonist Tanjiro, who one day finds his entire family killed, with his sister, Nezuko being turned into a demon. Some other stuff happens, which eventually leads to him becoming a part of the Demon Slayer Corps. This immediately establishes a goal, and kind of makes the goal\n                  ...\n          probably somewhat predictable, but I could be wrong since I haven\'t read the original source material. Some typical shounen tropes happen with one such being a training arc, but to be honest nothing too out of the ordinary. There were some parts that felt boring and felt some stuff was dragged on a bit too long, and there\'s a time skip as well, but otherwise, it\'s a pretty solid plot and I\'m excited where they\'ll go with this.\n\nArt and Animation - 9/10\nAdapted by the godly people at studio ufotable, I had high expectations on their artwork, and well, they delivered. The animation is crisp, clean, and fight scenes never fail to get me hyped, even if there is sometimes a bit too much talking. One thing that I absolutely love is water effects on Tanjiro\'s sword, they look so good, and I appreciate the visual style they\'re taking with this. Background art looks really nice with lots of detail put into it. 3D looks stunning, and I feel like they\'re one of the only studios that can really capitalize on mixing 2D and 3D animation. The only complaint that I have is that they\'ll have a 3D model of Tanjiro walking and it looks pretty jarring but other than that, it\'s great.\n\nSound - 10/10\nThe soundtrack was composed by the famous Yuki Kajira and a lesser known producer, Go Shiina, and can I just say that it sounds amazing? Each action scene that they play this soundtrack on I feel like is more memorable than the fight scene itself, yeah it\'s that amazing. On top of that, you have one of my personal favorite artists, LiSA, and you have a recipe for success. Both the OP and ED were sung by her, and they\'re also really good. If you have the time, I highly recommend you listen to the OP and ED by itself.\n\nCharacter - 7/10\nTanjiro is your typical shounen protagonist, optimistic, wants to protect a lot of stuff, which normally would be a complaint, but to be honest, I can\'t really hate him. Along with that, his special ""trait,"" we\'ll call it is also pretty unique and its executed in a great manner. Additionally, six episodes in, we\'re already getting some character development, as more episodes pass on, the stronger he\'ll eventually get. Nezuko is our other main character that has been introduced so far, and while she doesn\'t really get any dialogue, she\'s sometimes just adorable to watch, but other than that, I feel as if she\'s just kind of there as a plot device, but she does have her moments.\n\nEnjoyment - 9/10\nI have been enjoying this anime a lot. From the awesome visual effects to the absolutely amazing soundtrack composed by two talented people, and you have a highly enjoyable time from the beginning of the episode to the end of the episode. I\'m only taking off one point because there were some moments that I personally thought were boring, and seeing that it follows a bit of the stereotypical shounen tropes kind of made me roll my eyes a bit. Still very highly enjoyable, even if this might not be for you.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Sakura1230,"b""\n                The anime was pretty lit before the yellow kid and the pigman got introduced.\n\n\n\nTheir character design is horrible, the constant whining of the yellow kid and the irrational behavior of the pigman is hurting me.  One or two times, fine.  But they just kept doing the same thing every single episodes.  The story also dragged on at the same place for a few episode of useless scenes.\n\n\nSoft spoilers below\n------------------------------------\n\nThe fact that the yellow dude did almost ABSOLUTELY nothing makes me feel like he shouldn't be in the show, instead, character that looks like they have more potential, for example, the girl at\n                  ...\n          the spider web, having more meaningful lines than the yellow kid is not being introduced as a part of the show.\n\nI wish they don't drag on this for any longer and get them to start doing legit stuffs rather than fooling around with the crybaby\n              """,Demon Slayer
MainstreamBean,"b'\n                   Ahhh, Demon Slayer. If I were to describe you in very short terms, it would be ""a show with decent to mediocre content overshadowed by its own technical achievement.""\n\n   Firstly, the positives of this show.\n\n   Without a doubt, the main intrigue and appeal of this show upon first inspection is the art, and for good reason. Ufotable, the studio previously mentioned, is responsible for this shows adaptation into anime, and has overall done a fantastic job at keeping a consistent and unique artstyle incorporated throughout the show\'s airtime. Not only ranging from the shows beautifully rendered backgrounds, cool\n                  ...\n          ass powers, and character designs, but the translation of each element into animation is executed to great measure. Sure, there are admittedly a handful of scenes in which some CGI is incorporated into the foreground, such as character models and moving objects. However, as the show progresses, the use of it altogether is noticeably reduced, and even so, never looks particularly bad when incorporated either, especially considering how awful other shows can look in comparison when attempting this same fate. This is all encompassed and reflective of the fact that Ufotable has seemingly become masters in their craft of aesthetic presentation. The use of gradients, shadows, and contrasts in colors make many scenes, be it moving or standstill, a visual splendor to behold in this show. Previous examples from the same studio such as the Fate franchise and Kara no Kyoukai series impressed me on all levels with their visual presentation, and it doesn\'t fail to impress me here either. It all has a certain polish to it that I absolutely dig and can\'t help but worth mention.\n\n   Visual direction, especially amidst action scenes, flow impressively well together. There are a plentiful amount of cool action sequences, ranging from fights with other demons to simple conversation scenes in which we as an audience can get a real feel of our characters\' surroundings. Of course, it would be impossible to get away from this review without mentioning the infamous ending of episode 19. Despite the amazingly fitting soundtrack and incredible animation during that final stretch, what pushes it forward is the all impressive visual direction, as we witness a full view and experience of fast-paced movements and a consistent following of our MC flying through the air, swinging at every direction. Speaking about the soundtrack in that scene, the musical score of the entire show couldn\'t be understated either. Much of the music by Yuki Jajiura and Go Shiina aids to the overall tone of the show. From traditional instruments and vocals to intense orchestras and piano playing, I couldn\'t be more satisfied with the outcome and overall impression the show\'s music presents to me. Whether it be in times of a calming relaxed scene, or an actioned packed showdown, the score always seemed to find a way to fit into the mix of it all, enhancing and accompanying the overall atmosphere.\n\n   Well, that essentially wraps up the immediate positives I have to praise about the show. Now onto the mediocre and downright awful aspects.\n\n   Regarding its mediocrity, its stories main idea of fighting against demons after the sudden entire slaughtermen of your family by one isn\'t particularly special to me and happens to come off as a bit generic, however, nothing much was to be expected there anyways. The protagonist himself, Tanjirou, isn\'t necessarily that bad, but just underwhelming in terms of depth and personality, as much of it is lost while dedicated and fixed towards another individual, his sister Nezuko, who is admittedly pretty great. The pacing is decent at best, considering events throughout the story flow in such a way that I at least don\'t feel like I\'m being dragged along certain events for too long. However, it is worth mentioning though that the casual time skip implemented, that being of Tanjiros training period, was executed pretty badly, as powers and techniques weren\'t capitalized on properly, and felt more or less in the end just poorly explained and brushed over. Other than that, the flow of story events was done at a decent speed, with the exception of some scenes.\n\n   Regarding its downright awful aspects, there are a couple of major ones. First and foremost, the comedy. The comedy that makes up this show is genuinely horrible and unfitting and is the biggest offender this show has to offer by far. I\'m not sure what the authors intent was of incorporating such childlike and overly annoying immature humor, as I am sure the studio had to translate it one way or another into animation, but it\'s annoying as hell and I hate it. As I would like to coin it, as incredible as episode 19 was with its action scene, an abomination likewise was met in episode 11 with its introduction of Zenitsu begging a random pedestrian girl to marry him, followed by a rejection. Because of this rejection, what now plagued this show was a continuum of loud, obnoxious, and irritating screaming that ensued throughout the rest of the second half of this series. Secondly, in general, the main supporting cast of characters, that being Zenitsu and Inosuke, are inherently offenders of this show altogether, especially being the main tie in of its comedy. I had actually enjoyed the first half of the show to a decent amount, as there weren\'t any inherently jarring annoyances and issues that had come up. However, never had I once felt that these characters added anything necessarily positive to the show since their introduction, and instead rubbed off more on me as an annoyance and hindrance to the series than additional entertainment value. They served as failed comedic relief, with some background insight later on Zenitsu in an attempt to develop this already one-dimensional character, but in failure, never gave me any reason to care in the process. The chemistry between the three is unendearing and empty of any real bond. Hell, even the demon lady and boy introduced earlier in the show, with their personal attempts to fit into society and help our main cast with their future endeavors were more interesting and genuine than Inosuke and Zenitsu, but alas they were tossed aside. Thirdly, the whole family aspect never resonated with me, which the show seemed to allude to a lot as well. Callbacks to the family members in times of desperation or despair often occurred, but it always tended to feel like a weak link and a failed attempt of connection with myself as an audience member, since I was never given any experience or personal attachment to this family in the first place.\n\n   Overall, I personally find it hard to call Demon Slayer a genuinely good show. Sure, it can be full of beautiful art and animation, with a great soundtrack and some nice action which I did appreciate and enjoy along the way. However, this is all mainly to praise upon, once again, its technical achievements. Beyond that lies a lack of depth and originality. A disconnect with an audience member such as myself was truly apparent because clearly inhabiting mature fight scenes and story elements amidst a constant regurgitation of 5-year-old humor can paint an unbearable and inconsistent experience for me. Its highs in the show can be pretty high, but in contrast, It\'s lows can be glaringly low too. It would be a lie for me to say that I hadn\'t been entertained with the show at certain points in time, however, amongst all of it, it would also be inexcusable for me to disregard the personal annoyances and abundance of issues I had along the way.\n              '",Demon Slayer
snufflesbear,"b""\n                I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been obsessed with Japanese anime for more than 20 years. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m such an otaku that I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve watched (or heard of) almost every anime out there. But never have I been as moved or awed by any anime, as I have by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. I rarely write reviews, but I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m making an exception here because this anime is just too remarkable.\n\nWatching this anime, from Ep 1, has been an exceedingly emotional journey. The combination of flawless animation, gorgeous music and magnificent storytelling puts Kimetsu no Yaiba right at the top.\n\nHave I mentioned the animation? Have I? It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s bloody fantastic, pun intended. Obviously,\n                  ...\n          with better technology, there has been an increase in the number of stylistically beautiful anime over the years (e.g. Violet Evergarden, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works etc). But frankly, I think this anime surpasses them in the way it highlights movement and how it melds different angles and perspectives. The animation style used is so unique. I love the combination of the bright and (sometimes) garish comic book-like effects in the foreground and the more typical and subtle soft landscapes. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s stylistically brilliant and an absolute joy to watch.\n\nLet\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s talk about the audio effects. In most anime, music is used as an accent to the animation. Excellent song-writing is prevalent and memorable. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s why we have iconic theme songs and instrumentals (think Studio Ghibli). However, what makes this anime stand out, is the way the audio pairs with the animation. Beautiful music aside, I can no longer imagine the animation without the audio effects. They can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be separated; such is the perfection and appropriateness of the use of sound.\n\nFinally, storytelling. Let me clarify. The story itself (primarily about family, love and perseverance), isn't particularly fresh or new. However, it's how the story is told that makes it so very compelling. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not going to give any spoilers, but the writer has done everything right. Unless your heart is made of stone in the manner of Dr Stone, your heartstrings will be wrung. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m usually very critical of storytelling and character development but this anime has done those so well that my expectations soar with each episode. And every week, I continue to be impressed and delighted. Especially today\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Ep 19. Gosh. What a revelation. What an experience. Truly. \n\nAlso, having watched countless anime, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m rarely surprised by most story developments. The way this story is written is so incredibly creative that I literally can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t predict anything. I mean, it's a fantasy anime, so there's a lot of room for creativity. However, what I think this anime has done best, is how it makes you feel about the characters. Many might have realised it, but I think how we (the audience) feel about the characters (demons included) mirrors how Tanjiro feels about them. As it goes along, the anime introduces characters and we're left wondering who they are, why they behave a certain way. With more information, our bond with these characters grow as well. Certain behaviourisms (those who have watched more recent episodes will totally get this) start making sense and it endears these characters to us. And of course, I think Tanjiro is a decent main character because he somehow always successfully makes me root for him. He's driven by a very clear purpose and the decisions he makes stem from that. I love his empathy; it's an ideal and frankly, quite refreshing because it allows us to see things from different perspectives. The writer somehow managed to do all that, all the while maintaining a logical and cohesive storyline. This, is what I call top-notch storytelling. \n\nThe anime hasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even ended, but I can truthfully say that I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m positive that this is going to maintain its place as my favourite anime of all time. If you want to experience the very best of Japanese animation, look no further. This is the anime to go for. You won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t regret it.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Val3n,"b'\n                (SPOILERS:)\n And yes this was taken down but now that i\'ve watched 6 Episodes here is my review: If you want the overall here it is: Demon Slayer doesn\'t do anything new or ground breaking. The characters feel reused from other Shonens and the plot is like if Full Metal Alchemist and Tokyo Ghoul had a baby but that baby lacked drama, subtleties, or nuisanced characters. If you like Shonens, you\'ll like this show. It is entertaining but there\'s not much to it here.\nIf you\'re tired of the Shonen genre and hoped this show had even a little more depth to it\'s characters, world building\n                  ...\n          and how it\'s presented you\'ll be disappointed and my review will consists of these faults. \n\nSome more good (because I\'m trying not to be a complete Debbie Downer eh!):\nThe use of mystery to introduce every monster of the week is entertaining. When Episode 6 began I was getting flashbacks to The Witcher 3 and Claymore and it was genuinely enthralling. Well...it was until it showed how he solves the mystery. Much of it gets boring when Tanjirou constantly says things that are obvious and not needed to be said and it contributes to this anime\'s over use of narration but at first it was nice. \nThere is fun action. If you\'re watching this show just to watch some sword fights, you\'re golden.  \nArt is nice. Animation is stellar, not much to complain, you may get a few ugly CG moments but it passes quickly.\nWith that said and BTW SPOILERSSSSSSSS.....lets go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode one wasn\'t good in my opinion as Demon Slayers is one of the most generic animes I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve seen in a long time. Everything that it does has been done a thousand times and then some in other shows, some even more competent than this one. However I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t really downscore an anime on the uniqueness of its story because every story has been told before. Without looking at the story what we are left is the presentation and in my opinion, presentation and execution matters more. You can have a beautiful, poignant story filled with love and anguish but if it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s presented sloppily, the plots don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t hold together, or characters don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t feel believable then\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6.who gives a shit. And well, Demon Slayer is presented rather poorly. \nLet\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s talk about the good. The art and animation is fairly competent in their style and use of CG. The art direction is genuinely beautiful and subtle. Showering white snow and the faint puffs of warm breathes dissipating from characters really brought to life this fantasy world and it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s themes of the icy cruelty that the world befalls its citizens. Even though we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t yet see this cruelty aside from the rumors of Demons roaming about, which we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even get to see. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s about the only thing I found good in the first episode. I really wished this subtly was put into EVERYTHING ELSE in the episode. \nThe protagonist\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s family\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s sole purpose is to garner pity from the audience. They show how happy Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s family is but this is immediately contradicted with Tanjirou narrating \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93We still are struggling to survive even though we look like a happy family\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd. This problem doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t just stem from this anime but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s within the anime industry in general: they have the unfortunate habit of telling and not showing. Without Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s narration we would have no idea that they are poor and in dire need of income. Most of them seem fine in terms of health. They all wear rather colorful clothing that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s clean and none are starving or seemingly depressed about their situation. We don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even see a clear divide between how people look in town compared to his family, how am I supposed to believe that they are struggling to live? I know that the reason why they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t explore this is so that it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d make the audience feel even sadder when they die because it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s much more dramatic in terms of how the situation has now changed. From \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93look at us, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re all one big family \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93 to \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93look at how horrible and cruel everyone has been massacred, aren\'t you sad?!!!\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd. I know I\'m not being subtle here but neither is the anime. This does not do well for the believability of this struggling family and above all this doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t make me feel anything for them, as this plot device is very predictable, melodramatic, and done to death. What contributes to family\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s lack of believability is their on the nose dialogue. Everyone in this story talks straight out and says everything that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s right on their mind. If they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not doing that they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re narrating it for us, the audience because the writer (whether it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the original author or the scriptwriter for the episode) doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t understand real human communication. Again, it doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t have to be real but because this is a story about people, even if they are exaggerated by anime levels they should be believable. People rarely speak what\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s on their minds. We have our own goals, hidden agendas, wishes and so on. Because of that we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t usually just say things straight out. We euphemise, lie, and avoid the truth to spare others or ourselves. When characters start speaking on the nose, it shows a lack of good characterization and demonstrates how lazy the writer is being. All the characters just start sounding the same. We as an audience like to have a sense of discovery about characters and formulate why a character says something. When it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s said straight out, the audience has nothing to hold on to. In essence, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s BORING. Anyone could write stock characters like the family members of Tanjirou and Nezuko because there is no real character in them. If you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t believe me, then tell me what each of their personalities are without resorting to vague cliches? You can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t. The mother is motherly and caring, the siblings are sweet and cute and cheer on their big brother, the slightly older but still younger brother to Tanjirou is sort of rebellious but still loves his big brother. They are all stock characters. Nothing more. So? Even if I am right, how does this negatively impact the story you ask? Well, who really gives a damn that they died? We had no attachment to them as they literally were introduced and killed off screen less than 9 minutes later. WHO CARES. And when the audience doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t care about one of the main drives that starts the hero\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s journey, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve clearly done something wrong. We can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t identify with the motivations of Tanjirou (at least emotionally) and so why should we cheer him on. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not expressing that more time spent on characters would necessarily make them more developed although there is something to be said about that however how they are presented and established matters most. You can develop and make characters feel believable in a short amount of time but that takes subtly and showing not telling. For example in Star Wars: A New Hope we are introduced to Luke and his family and their deaths would eventually serve a similar purpose for his hero\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s journey. However it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s in how they are portrayed that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the most important. While Luke\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s family wasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t the most developed characters they were written with much more nuisance and conviction than the family in Demon Slayer. For one thing, Luke\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s aunt and uncle do have goals and worries for their nephew that they do not express forwardly to him. They worry about him and if he would grow to be like his father. They care so much for him that they make the excuse that he still has work to do on the farm in order to prevent him from enlisting in the Imperial Academy. As I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve stated they are not the most developed characters but they are good and do have solid believability for their roles. They don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t play up the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93we are a happy family trope\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd in order to set you up for the tragedy. None of the other Kamado family has this nuisance in them. Nothing for us the audience to grasp onto, because if they did, their loss would be much more tragic. Instead they do the cliche thing in which they play up the happy moments in order to create even more of a dramatic shift when shit hits the fan. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s lazy. \nLack of subtlety isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t just affecting the character writing but the music as well. The score is very on the nose with the emotions it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s trying to get out of you. If it needs you to feel sad, it plays this high strings sad violin. If it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s intense action it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s this pulsing orchestra. Nothing that really stands out but in fact creates a lot of melodrama within the scenes that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not needed. The scene where Tanjirou discovers all the mutilated bodies of his loved ones could have been much more effective without music at all because if done well we should have already been feeling sad for him. In fact no music would have set this scene apart and would have made it much more memorable because throughout the rest of the show music plays everywhere. However because the of the poor characterization and pacing they have to play up the music for the feeling to come across. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not good storytelling when you have to rely on something as a crutch to tell your story. \nSpeaking of crutches, the narration is terrible. Narration can be justified and done well such as in Oldboy (2003). Dae-su is captured within the first 10 minutes of the film and as he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s banging on his captor\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s door he narrates \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93If they had told me it was going to be fifteen years, would it have been easier to endure.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd What Dae-su says here is justified as throughout the sequence he seems to be losing his mind and contemplating such a thought gives him a false sense of hope, maybe even relief in his situation. We as an audience can participate in this too and even believe the opposite. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Had I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d been in his position and I knew i\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d be there 15 years it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d kill me inside\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd. This narration also serves a purpose in providing exposition that doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t feel forced as it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s provided through a conflict in the story. Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s narration is out of control and seems like the only story telling device the author knows how to use. We even get narration from Giyuu who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s introduced in the same episode and starts having this minute long monologue in his head to the audience while he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s fighting Tanjirou. This is problematic for a few reasons. One: we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even know Giyuu, he was barely just introduced. WHY ARE WE SWITCHING OUR PERSPECTIVE TO ANOTHER CHARACTER ALREADY WHEN OUR MAIN PROTAGONIST HASN\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2T YET BEEN ESTABLISHED? Two: why does he care that Nezuko seem human enough to leave alive? This is more of a plot hole but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s still a valid one. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a seasoned, demon hunter he should know how dangerous these things are and by letting Tanjirou have his way he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d be putting more people at risk to Nezuko. He even admitted that most of the time human-turned demons turn on their loved ones in a second\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s glance even if they seem docile at first. The reason why he lets Nezuko live isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t believable for the character that they set him out to be since he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s supposed to be this righteous type that serves the greater good no matter what. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d make much more sense if maybe he was a crazed morally ambiguous demon hunter who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve experimented on demons before and grew a fascination toward Nezuko since she seems to have kept some humanity. He let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s her and Tanjirou go because he wishes to see the outcome of their journey or whatever. You may not agree with my version but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a stronger reason for him letting them go than just optimism. Three: his monologue becomes a crutch for subtly and nuisance in the character. Maybe we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even need a reason why he let them go at first, we can hint at something in his past but not give in to it all the way, like maybe he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s had a similar experience or something but we do this in the moment of when he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s confronting Tanjirou through his interactions NOT INTERNAL MONOLOGUE. Let us see the anguish and horror on his face as he realize that the two survived a family massacre to tell the story and his reluctance to give Tanjirou answers. We can play off his character with these moments and give mystery to him and why he lets them go. This will create tension and internal conflict for his character and promises a character arc for him in the future. Already, by doing this he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d be much more interesting and plot progression won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t feel cheap. \nEpisodes 2 and 3 doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t do much to alleviate the problems with the show, although they are generally better now that we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re out of the beginning and heading towards the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93meat\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd of the show. These episodes are adequate but they still suffer from that constant expositioning and narration. For no reason Tanjirou and other characters just keep saying things that we already know or can infer. The demon that slaughter the family in episode 2 is a prime example of what I mean. In the episode he clashes with Tanjirou and gets hacked in the throat. He states \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Oh I can heal this is no time\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and it heals. Why would he say that? It brings me out of the supposed tensed moment more than anything when I have to questioned what was gained from that response. A better way to handle it would be this:\n(Tanjirou gazes from his fallen position to the demon before him. Its eyes widen with fear and pain as it clutches for its throat, a gaping crimson slit spitting blood everywhere. For a moment a wave of relief washes over him, believing that he had won the fight. The demon\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s lips curl upwards into a sadistic snarl and his eyes fill with amusement. He cackles uncontrollably as he releases the grip on his throat. To Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s surprise the wound is gone, only remaining is a faint line that keeps disappearing till it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s no more. The demon meets Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s quivering eyes once more before pouncing onto him, with beastial force.)\nIt works better when you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t treat your audience like idiots.\nThe fights lack tension. I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t find the demons particularly threatening as they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t really seem all that capable. Aside from a strong healing factor, humans seem like they can handle demons pretty well. Tanjirou is still a teenager but he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s managed to grapple with TWO demons without so much of a scratch. He even head-butts the demon and OF COURSE we get narration from the demon which says \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93 Urggh! His head is really hard!\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd. HIS HEAD IS REALLY HARD. He literally says that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6..(it reminds me of: ""Ow! Heat was Hot!"" Kudos and cheers if you know the reference ;) )\nIt hurts the world building when we question the main threat of the whole series. If the author wanted Demons to come off as terrifying beasts he should be very exact in distinguishing the differences in power levels between humans and demons. The line gets pretty blurred in the OP as everyone is unleashing \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Bankais\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and doing superhuman feats and again later on during training when Makomo says you can become as strong as demons when you just \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93breathe\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd a certain way. The anime/manga Claymore does this significantly better by outright stating that humans are nowhere near the level of even a basic Yoma. Killing one would take years of training and understanding Yoma as seen with Raki and even then Yoma still have the added benefit that they are totally undetected by human means, which again puts them at a disadvantage. Even if the first demons they meet are supposed to be \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93low level\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd or whatever they should still be a huge threat but the he defeats the Ep 2 demon pretty easily. Later on many of the other Demons he encounter act like third rate Bond villains. They stop their attacks and go on a minute long monologue telling Tanjirou who they are, what they\'ve done, and their plans for eating him. It\'s silly more than threatening. You remember how menacing Titans were in Attack on Titian? They didn\'t say or do any of that, it was all in their actions and what they did. Or like in Kabaneri of The Iron Fortress, again the zombies in there were threatening and horrifying without having to go "" Roaarr, roarr, I\'m gonna eat cha little boy!"". I\'m not saying they should be mute, but they should be scary because they\'re doing scary things, not telling it. It also doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t help that he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s already got one on his side so every time he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s in even a little trouble she can bail him out. (And this is one of her only 2 purposes, the other is to be MOE as FUUUCCK!) \nAlso a point that never gets addressed even up to episode 3 is Nezuko. Why does being turned into a Demon apparently make you a mute? I mean she\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s human enough not to attack and eat Tanjirou shouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t she be able to say something or communicate in some manner if you want to make the argument that the BDSM pole is preventing her? It\'s not a magic seal or anything, it\'s literally something Giyuu just shoves in her mouth thinking that she can\'t just hulk out and rip that thing off. If being turned into a demon makes you a raging animal with no conscious thought then how did that demon in episode 2 talk to him and even seem to have a banter with him? Or any of the other Demons later on. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m okay with any reason just give us a reason that makes some sense. You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d think that Tanjirou would have tried something, anything, in order to communicate with her as she was the only who survived the massacre. If this is not possible then it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s important that it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s addressed or else it becomes a plot hole. I know it was stated that Nezuko is saving her energy by inducing into a comatose state so she doesn\'t feed on people but I find this reason faulty and boring in terms of what could have been an alternative exploration into character dynamics of the two. The master says she\'s inducing this sleep but why hasn\'t any other demons done this then? I\'m sure there have been others who\'ve loved their siblings enough not to want to eat them but I guess their love wasn\'t as special as Nezuko\'s love for Tanjirou? I guess other demons didn\'t love their siblings enough to try this. And this method seems to work flawlessly without any problems because she still saves him whenever the author deems it\'s necessary and the anime doesn\'t show any drawbacks aside from her sleeping a lot. It\'s a bit hard to believe. \nWhen they showed the bodies of the family that was just murdered I thought Tanjirous was going to do the smart thing and hack pieces off to feed Nezuko, maybe even save some for later. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s brutal but he loves her and it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d SHOW the lengths he be willing to go for her. But that doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t happen. \nThe training montage is not good because we are constantly being pulled out of the moment by Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s narration. Tanjirou writes in his journal about every single aspect of his training after he has experienced it already and this creates a disconnect with the audience. We can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t experience the training with him because he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s already done in in the past since he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s recalling everything that happened in the past tense. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to actually see his growth when he just says he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s getting stronger instead of the anime taking the time to show us that. Again we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t need narration of the things he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s learning and in fact it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d be much more impactful if we were kept in the present with Tanjirou and learning along with him and his master. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d be able to create a connection with the master as we would be with Tanjirou learning the ways of Demon Slaying with him as it happens. Such as in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back we are in the moment with Luke as he trains with Yoda. Because we are in the present with him and Luke is not taking a step back to narrate for us we build a connection with Yoda. Everyone remembers Yoda despite being introduced and put into only one movie of the original saga. Can you even imagine if Luke had narrated to the audience and said: \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93 I told Yoda I wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be able to lift up the X-Wing even if I tried and then he told me: \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xcb\x9cDo or do not, there is no try\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd We see Luke\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s failures throughout the training, and these failures are rooted with his character. I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t really see an internal connection between Tanjirou and his training and how it relates to one another. Sabito later says that he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93man enough\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd but how does that have anything to do with his character? When was Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s arc that he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93man enough\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd? Yeah he didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93finish\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd the demon in episode 2 but he didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t hesitate to slit its throat with an ax. If this was his arc then shouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t the proper conclusion to his arc be that he slains a demon all on his own? But instead he has to split a rock in two. I know he kills Morph Demon but that part isn\'t part of hid training arc. The master even said that his training is complete and that he\'s accepted to the Final Night now. I understand the reason why the training was so rushed but because of that it lacks believability. Another example is My Hero Academia the first season. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not the biggest fan of MHA but it does Deku\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s training a whole lot better than Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s. Deku is accepted by All Might as an apprentice and a similar training ensues but the difference here is that Deku rarely exposites for the audience, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s used scarcely and visual changes of Deku is put at the forefront without a lot of narration. We don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t hear Deku saying \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93 OMG this fridge is so heavy\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93All Might told me I have to be as swift as the ocean so we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re going swimming\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd. No it\'s all shown and we can infer it all. The ending of the montage is a climatic pan of Deku, screaming with all his might, bruised and batter, as he stands tall on top a mountain of collected trash, his tone body against the roaring winds. NICE! \nThe fight with the Morph Demon was narration galore and it\'s ridiculous. I\'m tired of writing the same thing over again so if you like Shonens you\'ll be fine with this fight. \nTanjirou\'s mercy he shows to it is really inconsistent even within the same episode. If it\'s in his character to show mercy to Demons then what about the others he killed in the same Episode or the Gloop Tripplet Demons in ep 6 where he gets pissed that they told him they like supple young 16 year old girls. He charges at these with no mercy but the Morph Demon was the one who got the soft attention because he missed his brother? I\'m fine if this is part of his character but the way it\'s portrayed is not believable especially when they try to justify it by trying to make you sympathize with the Morph Demon in a cheap flashback, as if he didn\'t murder and enjoy the fleshy bodies of little kids...seriously...who really feels bad for him. There\'s a serious disconnect of emotions when you can\'t identify with what the Protagonist is doing because it makes no sense and you wouldn\'t ever see yourself doing that same thing. This angelic mercy he has is a contrived trope that has been already done to death in other animes. Sure the opposite reaction is also a cliche, having raging hatred towards them. However one feels justified while the other feel forced in order to make sure you know Tanjirou is such a good guy.  \nI do agree with the Morph Demon on one thing though:\n\n Yeah, that master literally did send those kids to their deaths...i don\'t care how ""sorry"" they make him to be, he still did it. I laughed because they even pointed this out with no self awareness. If the Demon Slayers are truly in control of the Final Nights then they should know exactly what\'s going on. It\'s a plot hole when they allow the demons to get that strong without any safeguards. You\'re Demon Slayers right? Aren\'t you supposed to be protecting kids? That\'s like if in My Hero Aca, the entrance exams was to fight a whole city filled with unsupervised  super villains, and one in particular had become so powerful he\'s survived multiple trials for years and if they get killed or whatever it\'s whatever. Young boys , young girls...whatever right? This actually makes the Demon Slayers Corp outright inept or ruthless with no repercussions. If they\'re this merciless, shouldn\'t villager and people outright despise them, why isn\'t Tanjirou angry at this. His character is that he wants to protect people, SAVE PEOPLE, yet the final nights seem like they\'re just sending kids to their deaths for no good reason and he doesn\'t bat his eye? In Full Metal Alchemist Edward is constantly at odds with the State because of shit like this and he\'s interesting and well fleshed out because of it. Edward seems real, while this seems contrived. \nAlso I was right, Nezuko is a Deus ex machina. She\'s cute and I\'ll admit her character design is very attractive. SUE ME!  \nOverall, Demon Slayer doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t do anything new or particularly well. The characters are dull and overused, the story is riddled with plot holes or just contrivances, and the world doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t feel very well- fleshed out. At the heart of all the problems with Demon Slayer is it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s lack of subtlety and overuse of \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93telling rather than showing\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd to convey it\'s story. Like I said if you like Shonen, this anime will be just right for you. For anyone else, it\'s a flashy trip that unlike the devoured children in the show, lacks any meat or substance.\n              '",Demon Slayer
zeltron,"b""\n                In life sometimes you get bored of the hobbies you used to have as a child. Anime is one of them in my case. After being disappointed season after season with countless fast food adaptations. I decided to put a stop at my once favorite hobby.\n\nOf course after a short 2 year hiatus you cant possibly ignore that even in that time frame at least something decent had to come out. Generally speaking most popular anime could be considered decent if only viewed on a surface level, but you're in for a surprise. \n\nNaturally after having thoughts of going back to watching anime. I decided\n                  ...\n          to check what was fairly popular these last months. Spotting Demon Slayer want difficult at all, since it had such an bulked up mean score here in MAL making it into the top 20 ranked anime in this page, So of course I was interested. \n\nOverwhelmed in excitement and interest I went onto crunchyroll, paid a monthly subscription, and without any doubts I dived right into this series.  (6PM)\n\nAfter 12 hours of binge watching anime like in my old days, having completed Demon Slayer, with tired eyes, weak calves (after only having snacks for half a day) I turned off my pc, got off my chair and opened up the windows, After letting the air get in my living room I went ahead and prepared myself a meal. \n\nAfter 2 hours of reflecting on what i just watched, I could only find myself with nothing but sheer disappointment and deep regret. Feeling the same way just like 2 years ago. Reminiscing on why I even went on hiatus in the first place. \n\nSuch a generic and mediocre title. with nothing new to offer is seriously being tossed around with amazing titles like Berserk and HxH? Is this the standard for an 8 and 9 nowadays? Generic writing and mediocre plot points? The soundtrack is mediocre at best, the animation is subpar, characters are so generic and forgettable.\n\nOVERALL A FORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE FROM START TO END.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Yuri-Crusader,"b""\n                                 \n\n\n Welcome to my review of Kimetsu no Yaiba!! Minor spoiler warning!! \n\n\n\nThe Kamado family lives happily in peace in their seclude cabin high up in the snowy mountains .After the main protagonist Tanjirous father passing away some time ago, he have taken over he's responsibility and providing for he's family .One day after selling some coal in the village nearby and coming home later than expected, he stubble through the door and are met by a gruesome and horrifying sight! He's family have been brutally slaughtered .Hes\n                  ...\n          mother and siblings are laying dead in-front of hes feet,but in this tragedy life still existing and breathing, hes beloved sister Nezuko have survived the macabre attack.But as a cruel and terrible twist of fate she is now a demon herself and hunger for humans flesh to devour! Tanjirou refuses to give up and swear to avenges the death of his family! But mostly to restore humanity back to his sister!\n\n\n\nThe story itself especially early in, may feel extremely simplistic uninspired and boring .Village boy get family or village killed and sets out for seeking revenge.Never heard that one before. But with some good twist drama segment and fast even pacing,Combined with some interesting female characters and great side story's it have some interesting factors as well. And the way it being told is pretty entertaining rather than feeling slow and tedious .Its noting special but it works overall   \n\n\n\nThe animations are just stunning from time to time.The action flows like the mighty river and are a grand spectacle to watch .This anime have gorgeous flashy action scenes with great lightning effect  that are really enjoyable to watch, and makes me looking forward to the next fight! \n\n\n\nSadly I think the design on the males in this anime got little attention, and is very dull plain and noting to remember it by.But the demons and females on the other hand have great attention both in details and design, that defiantly are memorable and made a great impacted\n\n\n\nWhen it come to characters this anime total fails again with the males . They are as interesting and deep as a kiddie pool. The main trios are the most uninspired stereotypical predictable and boring set of reused anime characters i have ever seen . Tanjirou is overly good and wants to help, Inosuke wants to be strong and like to fight, and the last one Zenitsu wants to cry and are afraid of fighting or getting seriously injured.But for some odd reason he joins a society that are in war with the demons!,, Doesn't that make sense?,,NO it doesn't. There are no complexity no deeps to be found .Alone they are horribly and boring enough but together they are a irritating deadly force of chaos! That destroys everything I like in this anime . It's like a five-year old was in charge over those so-called humour segments.All they do is run around screaming ans chasing etch other like five years old do. I'm sry but I don't find that very funny. More irritating and infuriating, the Biggest problem is the character Zenitsu nonstop whining and crying .Complaining seems to be that characters main trait, As soon he is in picture the crying and bitching start and never stop! And with a very high-pitched  voice which gives me a headache!  Don't you just love the things in life that give you a headache? I don't. I want to kill it with fucking fire!\n\n\n\nAgain the females come to the rescue. They are lifting this anime up and opposite from the male, The female characters are interesting and don't act like misbehaving children all the time .They are beautiful and very alluring. Main character is a little interesting conundrum and I thirst for more information about her.The butterfly girls that get introduce later in is also a huge plus for the story. And with all the good female characters, at-least some enjoyment are to be found in this mess\n\n\n\nMy experience in the whole was extremely inconsistent .The action was incredible and i love every second of it.But the male trio especially the cry baby make some scene unbearable and they are mains so they get a huge amount of screen time,,Running screaming in your face or crying! In the end its hard to judge. I hate it! I love it! I hate it! I love it! So I give it 5/10 \n\n\n\nThis anime is trash but its kind of shiny and flashy trash that are nice and fun to look at. When it doesn't piss you off with its poorly written humour or infuriating characters\n\n\n\nI dedicate this review to every female in Kimetsu no Yaiba, Thank you for making this anime at-least acceptable\n              """,Demon Slayer
lt_wassile,"b'\n                Once upon a time, the anime industry came up with the perfect formula to create highly acclaimed shounen one after the other; however, as time passed, this pattern became repetitive and, while a few next-gen shounen have been able to achieve their objective following this predetermined path, most of them have faltered along the way.\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba is not your typical shonen anime but at the same time it is. It does not have your archetypical main character that accomplishes all his goals through the power of friendship and/or by activating his hidden power -which is never revealed until the plot armour established is not\n                  ...\n          life-saving enough-; instead, Tanjirou is a run-of-the-mill guy who does not become a one-of-a-kind swordsman overnight, but spends months training, shedding his blood, sweat, and tears, showing the story of struggle and how it has molded his character.\nIt does not attempt to build a story based on a main protagonist who wants to become stronger justified by the simple fact of being the strongest or proving the world wrong, but for a much deeper motive.\nIt\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s also not afraid to deviate from the standard path taken by most shonen of advancing as little as possible in each episode, mainly done to extend the journey \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9cand the money raised- as much as possible. Speaking about this, Kimetsu no Yaiba solid pacing makes the show advance energetically, although it does not forget to catch some breath when the situation justifies it \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9cas in ep. 19, if you know what I mean\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6-.\nStill, it follows the standard battle shonen familiar-hero\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s journey plot of: member(s) of family killed fuels progress, finds someone who trains/instructs him, passes an exam to become part of a faction, and, after becoming strong enough, ends up in an expedition where he makes friends and forges bonds, while at the same time encounters people (either comrades or villains) that change his way of thinking and acting towards life. However, if it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s done correctly, who says this is a bad thing? \n\nAs you can see, the plot is rather simple and straightforward, as nothing really stands out story wise speaking, though it doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t change the fact that the show is remarkably enjoyable. Despite a pretty slow start where some parts felt quite boring, the story came up to be really attention-grabbing, and these first episodes turned to be important for establishing a solid, well-paced plot -so please wait a little bit for the action! -. Also, the power progression pace is nicely done too, making it quite satisfying to watch them apply their training to the battles. Besides, the way different situations are expressed through narration is pretty noteworthy, transforming this shounen-type anime into a really good piece of story exposition.\n\nUfotable is just flexing on other studios right know. Digital era has given studios the opportunity to develop in so many different ways, though Ufotable has seized the opportunity to improve as much as or more than anybody else, and Kimetsu no Yaiba represents a good case in point.\nWith a unique art style, they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve achieved to display an outstanding hack-and-slash action-packed animation really eye-catching to the viewer. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s mainly thanks to a really fluid and lifelike animation, which pays close attention to even \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93minor details\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd such as rendering, moving backgrounds or characters\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 portrayal. I mean, who would not love to see humans slashing demons, demons crushing humans, in short, both fighting against each other in a life-and-death struggle with flashy action sequences full of intense colouring, smooth shading and outrageous use of angles that enhances the experience?\nAdditionally, the way which music and voice acting has been used on this 1st season has been amazing. Without going into comparing its OST to that of other shows, we could say that it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a soundtrack that it neither will remember for the ages nor would get stuck in replay on your mind for weeks, although when watching the show it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s pretty noticeable and makes a lot of scenes much more enjoyable and mesmerizing, making it pretty obvious that both the piece itself and the moments chosen for the OST to be played were extremely well thought-out.\n\nLast but not least, characters. Some think Zenitsu is irritating; some think he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hilarious. Some think Tanjirou is a light-hearted, kind, strong person; some think he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s too trustful. BUT WHO THINKS THAT NEZUKO IS NOT WORTHY OF WORSHIPING? NONE. Jokes apart, characters play an important role in KnY, as they carry the whole series in a team effort, meaning that most of the characters with some screen-time are important, as they play a part in the development of the story and/or our protagonists; they do this quite well, making most of them really likeable and relatable \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9ceven though we are talking about demons and swordsman- as, their feelings, goals and states of mind are much like our own, as well as their abilities \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9cspeaking exclusively about the human union-, which are obtained via loads of effort, and not magically.\n\nHowever, all is not yet rosy either, as there are diverse subjects, mainly with regard to the story \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9cand I won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t talk too much about it in order to avoid spoilers-, where I sensed -at times- hurriedness and lack of strategic and operational thinking, like in the sequence of different events or with CGI\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s utilization. And we can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t forget about that really slow start\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6 \n\nNevertheless, all these \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93complaints\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd are something minor and end up being ostracised by all the positive points of the series, making it impossible to deny that this anime is one of a kind.\n              '",Demon Slayer

theRealGuyFieri,"b""\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba, or Demon Slayer, an overhyped, overrated and over almost everything show that fans can't stop praising and talking about this hell of a mess.\n\n\nYes, after a year or more from dropping it initially, I have completed it and rest assured, it's not as good as people say it is. \n\n\nThis is my super deconstructive take on the show.\n\n\nFrom the studio that brought you, urgh, Fate comes another stupidly popular mainstream series that is Demon Slayer. Where do I start, I can't comprehend to you how much it irritates me or saddens me when a friend or anyone comes up to me and\n                  ...\n          say 'dude you should check out Demon Slayer it's really good', just for me spoil their fun by saying 'it's not that good'. Without fail, almost everyone that I have encountered replies 'What? No way. It's great!'. I am truly annoyed by how big this series has become, how this low-tier Shounen series has managed to climb it's way to the top due to shameless fan-service or fan-baiting if I would call it. I'll admit, I didn't hate all of it. But to compare it to what people say it is and to actually watch it firsthand, you can eat my shit. This show is nowhere close as good or as 'legendary' as a ton of people are saying it to be.\n\nI'll start with the good side of the show. Yes, I'll admit, the visuals are very good. With the show's distinctive thick outlines of characters to the colorful template of the character's clothing. This show is really unique in terms of style and visuals, everyone who sees's a character or anyone from the show would know immediately that this is Demon Slayer. And... That's about it, that's all that is that caught my attention or in some ways interest me.\n\nNow, this is where the fun begins, the downfalls. For a start, this show's story is painful mediocre and lame. It's a very simple concept of our protagonist suffering from what the antagonist did in the beginning and it's just him finding his way back to bring vengeance on to this antagonist. I don't mind a simple structure of a story, but what you need to do to make that simple structure interesting is to add in the details and to make all those small matters an enjoyable experience. What Demon Slayer presented was pretty repetitive with our main character fighting and then getting summoned to another mission and repeat. I do compliment them with the addition to more main characters to our Tanjirou and Nezuko pair because, to be frank, our main boy Tanjirou isn't really an enjoyable character to listen to. But what the studio did when filling in those gaps in between plots are kinda poorly done. At times, the pacing is off, and off I mean very off. Those times are when the characters talk too much and fight scenes don't really feel as fast-paced or as action-packed as it should. At moments the time just seems to pass so slowly and other moments are sonic fast. \n\nThe second installment of the downfall, the characters. Tanjirou is one of the most Naruto kind of character since Naruto. His over-optimistic behavior paired up with his never-ending feeling of 'not giving up' is truly annoying. But what I want to focus on him is how the show tries so hard to push his plot-armor. Specifically, episodes 18, 19 and 20. These few episodes just blew my mind on how is he still alive, I know everyone's protagonist needs to have some level of plot-armor but, what the show did wasn't even hiding it. There are so many moments where I went 'he's gonna die' and miraculously, he lives! Who would have seen that coming... Not just once, I counted at least 5 times where Tanjirou was sure to die and he didn't, this really pisses me off. I can just imagine the writers/author was going through when making the scene, 'Oh so our dude is fighting one of the broken bad guys, so the bad guys used this fucking lightsabers-ass web-shooting thing, oh so he just avoids it no biggy. Oh, he's sword is broken? No worries he still can do more DAMAGE WITH A BROKEN SWORD AND PERHAPS WIN.' Sure. Now that I knew the background before the fight scene in episode 19 (before I didn't) it just removes all the enjoyment I had when seeing that fight scene alone.\n\nAnother fucking issue is the villain, like, we got this Michael Jackson wanna-be asshole that is just turning people into demons. We later got to know that he's a boss man that handles big important business, then this comes to my head. Why was he in the woods near Tanjirou's house? Like we have seen him hiding in the city in Tokyo, what brings him to a village? Plus, what are his main goals? This is another big issue of the show, characters or antagonists having no purpose or driving factor. So take Muzan, he's the boss, turning people into demons. So what does he want to do, take out the Hashira? So what is he gonna do after that, take over Japan? Ok then what. See where I'm coming at? Like they have no driving factor or a strong purpose to what their goals or objectives are. So Tanjirou wants to cure his sister, the ONLY demon that has ever been friendly to a slayer out of the WHOLE years of the Demon Slayer Corps. But why? I don't see an issue, she's clearly having a pretty good time being a demon, I don't see the issue, this is a win-win in my eyes. Speaking of villains, gosh they suck. They're the usual badly bad guys in almost any lame-ass Shounen series. Like in episode 20, the reason for that Rui spider motherfucker's purpose was to make a family? Are you serious? Like, was he that pathetic and trying so hard to be pitiful that we the audience are supposed to swallow that shit? This brings me to my third installment.\n\nThe overuse of trying to be pitiful. This can be seen almost everywhere throughout the show, we have main characters and side characters and villains all having a tragic past likey involving their parents or family getting killed so on and so on. If the author or writers are so tryhards on this then fine, I pity them for doing such a poor job or trying to make the depths of the characters. Every time, without fail, our main dude Tanjirou when fighting an intense match will suddenly talk about his parents or how he wants to bring Nezuko back to normal. Not just him but the majority of the characters have a tragic backstory or a past and they talk boring shit about how they want to avenge or overcome that challenge. Boring stuff I'll say. Speaking of pity, I really pity the person who comes up with the script or maybe it's the person making the subtitles. In episode 7 where Tanjirou was in that demonic swamp puddle involving that 3 demons, he said 'The air was thinner on top of Mt.Sagiri!'. You idiot, you're not a fish you can't breathe underwater, there is no air under the water you moron. There are other moments of stupid scriptwriting but this is one of them.\n\nLastly, and there's actually more but I'll cut it short, I want to talk about the laziness of the author. Does it kill them (preferred pronoun) to do some research when making the world and character? So for a start, the character Inosuke, seeing him with two swords wants to make me kill myself. While yes there are records of people using two swords, not at once you fucking dingus. Come on with have experienced this a few times now, a popular one being Deadpool. It's not very functional when using two double-handled swords, both swords make it very impractical due to one sword blocking the other or the strength distribution not being even. Another this is the occasional technological gap, there are times when what seems like the dawn of man when the whole surrounds are just trees and suddenly a bustling city like Tokyo. There are cars and trains available so why do we only see them so occasionally. Plus, gosh there are guns in this era, all of you aren't savages using swords all the time. Speaking of swords, the only interesting one was the sword-rapier that Shinobu used, the rests are just your typical samurai sword action. This plays a small part in the story but it affected my enjoyment.\n\n-SCORES-\n\nCharacter-3/10: Everyone has either no family or families been killed or they'd peed their pants in their early days or just something tragic happening at a young age. So Zenitsu's a simp, but I do like the part when he used his simp-ness to his advantage in the training involving girls. Plus, he's really noisy, slightly too noisy I feel, over-exaggerated to just give the borderline audience some 'unique character personality'. Inosuke, also sometimes too extra, like I feel they are too scripted in being 'them', being loud and over the top. It gets tiring fast. Fuck Tanjirou, he's too entitled thinking he's the only one that lost his family thinking he is the only one that can stop Muzan. Even Nezuko I'll admit she's way to fan-bait like she's just cute for the audience to say 'oh my gosh she so kawaii' and stuff like that. I don't really care cause I feel all these are just cheap shots to gain a fanbase, what's worse is that it has succeeded.\n\nArt-8/10: I will say despite the animation looking smooth and pleasing, I do see times of underproduction due to the long talk time or the irritating flashbacks or the reuse of scenes. Plus, I realized that after the studio started using those 'funny faces' with the dotted eyes and silly expression, they used it way too many times. Another cheap move to attract viewers.\n\nWriting- 3/10: Oh is it boring, I will admit the problems do become numb after the first half of the show and the rest is just bad but at a consistent level. I will admit the Fire Force has a more interesting concept that this but they didn't do a better job than Demon Slayer of course. Definitely a good example of a top-notch Shounen is, of course, Hunter X Hunter. I feel what Demon Slayer is doing with the writing is lazy but they just get most of the pull factor from the audience is the art and the visuals.\n\nSound-5/10: Holy shit is the sounds overused, every time a demon appears that 'aaaaaaaaaaaaa' sound of a woman singing comes up and every intense scene has that same repetitive fight song. Additionally, I heard the intro gets a lot of praise and I really don't see the appeal, sure it's fine but it's so anime-ish that it's blain and boring. Just a catchy chorus with FAST SING is what you need to get a ton of likes apparently....\n\n\nOverall, I expected shit and I got shit, I pressed X to doubt to all those people that said Demon Slayer is good. If it weren't so overhyped, definitely my scores will be slightly less biased but seeing and experiencing the situation of the 'Demon Slayer Hype' is really annoying. \n\nStrong to a Decent 3\n              """,Demon Slayer
Dukino,"b'\n                It\'s the heart that drives people. So grow yours to as strong as it can be. That\'s beautiful, sums up to me what the message of Kimetsu no Yaiba Demon Slayer really is. Follow your heart, listen to it, if your heart is strong you can do anything. The story of Tanjiro and Nezuko is a tragedy there is no doubt but it never feels hopeless. Even at his lowest Tanjiro never gives up, as cliche as that sounds it matters to hear. Some famous words of ""Don\'t give up, don\'t ever give up"". Tanjiro and his heart are the embodiment of that ideal. Striving\n                  ...\n          to find a way to cure Nezuko, defeat Muzan, and never stopping along the way. Pushing forward even when your body breaks, even when your soul is crushed. Keeping your heart strong.\n \nKimetsu doesn\'t break the mold in any significant way but it handles those old shonen archetypes pretty damn well. Tanjiro could\'ve easily been a run of the mill angry protagonists who wants to kill all the enemies, demons in this case. He doesn\'t to that though. Just as Shinobu said in the finale, he has a clear goal. The top, the big dog not these little pups. If they\'re hurting people of course they\'re to be stopped but the number one goal will never change, these are just stepping stones. Nezuko being his driving force when he\'s even lower than low. When Tanjiro even for a second thighs of stopping there\'s always Nezuko he has to look upon and fight for. Whom herself can handle a brawl pretty well. Always a joy seeing the Kamado siblings team up in battle.\n \nThe supporting cast is one of my favorite in shonen. Zenitsu and Inosuke alone would make for great lead characters in their own stories. Complementary to Tanjiro and Nezuko they add great foils and instruments of change for the Kamados. Whilst having their own great character arcs in the middle of all this. Zenitsu going from whining about the littlest to even now being pretty resolute in his decision to go on the train mission, no dragging him or anything. Inosuke a bit more subtle development but he\'s definitely domesticated somewhat from when we first meet him at the Drum House. Learning to work with others to accomplish something greater instead of just fighting them.\n \nAll of this to not even dive into Giyu the best big bro around putting his life on the line for these kids, Shinobu the butterfly queen of grace helping them along in getting stronger, Urokudaki getting the Kamados started on this path, Tamayo showing there\'s a way to break Muzans curse. So many people helping out crew along their journey. It\'s an endearing and exciting cast to say the least. Ever along we go with bounds of more amazing moments for so many of them.\n \nVisually I don\'t think there\'s anything I could say that hasn\'t been said already. Best looking show of the year in my eyes. Hinokami is the cherry on top with all the incredibly stunning moments brought to the screen. Ufotable has outdone themselves. Truly a marvel in animation, it\'s ridiculous to think a tv anime could look this good. Nearly movie level quality throughout the show amped up in its fights. My one and only real complaint I\'d have is the pacing. Could\'ve been faster but honestly it\'s not a big deal. Gave us a bunch of intense cliffhangers to gasp at as well as I\'m sure giving ufotable the ample prep for all the big scenes. \n\nDemon Slayer has I think always been good but I think sometimes it takes seeing a story brought to life for you to really appreciate it. That\'s what happened with me here. The anime has made me savor the manga that much more, especially with it reaching it\'s end soon. What was adapted here isn\'t even the best the series has to offer is the crazy thing. There\'s so much more so see and experience. Loved this anime to the moon and back. A fantastic experience to participate in these past twenty six weeks. Ufotable is a blessing onto us all. \n10/10, one of the best this year\n              '",Demon Slayer

Season 1 began airing on April 6th, 2019 with the final episode of the season airing on September 28th, 2019.\n\nHere\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the basic plot:\n\nOur protagonist is Tanjirou Kamado (Voiced by Natsuki Hanae). Following his father\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s death, Tanjirou supports his family by selling charcoal. Despite their hardships, his family lives a content, happy life. That is, until demons attack and slaughter his family, save for his sister, Nezuko (Voiced by Akari Kit\xc3\x85\xef\xbf\xbd). It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not as simple\n                  ...\n          as two siblings surviving a demon attack though, Nezuko has been turned into a demon, but she still retains some human thought and emotion \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c enough to keep from killing and eating other humans, at least. With no other options left, Tanjiro becomes a Demon Slayer in hopes to turn his sister human again and avenge his family.\n\nNow some detail:\n\nOver the course of their adventure, Tanjirou, of course, gets stronger and learns new skills, in particular he greatly advances his Water Breathing techniques, to use against the demons they face along the way. Nezuko sees a lot of development as well, she does become a bit more human-like, but is ultimately still a demon and must fight her urges to kill and devour, and she learns she is a unique case for a human turned demon, having special abilities such as \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Blood Demon Art\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd (cool demon attacks) and she can sustain herself without eating humans.\n\nThroughout the series they meet other Demon Slayers, such as Zenitsu Agatsuma (Voiced by Hiro Shimono) who has the Thunder Breathing ability, and Inosuke Hashibira (Voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka) who was raised by a wild boar and has the self-taught Beast Breathing ability. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s great to make new friends and all, but Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s sights only focus further when he discovers the identity of the power demon who is responsible for the creation of almost every demon that exists \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c including Nezuko \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Muzan Kibutsuji (Voiced by Toshihiko Seki). Not only is he incredibly powerful, but he commands a force of twelve demons known as the Twelve Kizuki (\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Twelve Demon Moons\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd), whom Tanjirou and the other Demon Slayers must defeat first if they want to even have a chance against Muzan.\n\nTanjirou is a great character. He is incredibly kind, but that isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t to say he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s weak by any means. Seeing this world through his eyes is what makes the series stand out among other \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93demon fighting\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd troupes. Yes, these demons murder and kill people, but 90% of the time they didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t become a demon as a choice. They didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t WANT to become demons \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c they were either tricked by Muzan or turned against their will and Tanjirou is able to sense their deep despair at what they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve become, allowing us to see what happened in their past that led them to their transformation. Honestly, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s usually SUPER sad. There are also other cases like Nezuko, demons who fight the urge to kill \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c such as Dr. Tamayo (Voiced by Maaya Sakamoto, a talented doctor who was converted into a demon by Muzan, which caused her to kill and eat her entire family. She eventually found a way to alter her cells to allow her to survive on a small amount of blood and no flesh and is working to find a cure for demons.\n\nThere are demons who are straight up horrible, but often times you find yourself feeling sympathy for them, the way Tanjirou feels and the other slayers have a hard time comprehending. Rather than kill them to destroy them, Tanjirou kills them to free them from an endless suffering on themselves and others. It a show full of action, but also one that strikes you on an unexpected emotional level.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 10 / 10\n\nMake sure you check out Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, now streaming season one on Crunchyroll and Hulu.\n              '",Demon Slayer
jimbionicles,"b""\n                I never really write reviews, but I feel like I had to for this one.\n\nStory: 1/10\n\nGenuinely one of the most boring, horribly written, cringe-worthy shounen stories ever written. This show is on-par with shows like Fairy Tail, writing-wise. The show is extremely simple and predictable, not once was I shocked, sad, happy, angry. I did not feel a single thing watching this show, other than boredom. How many times are we going to have to see your typical young boy suffers tragedy and becomes an epic super fighter story before we get sick of it?\n\nCharacters: 1/10\n\nShallow, undeveloped, stereotypical shounen characters that do not get an\n                  ...\n          ounce of development throughout the entire show. As a friend expertly said, the main trio is just Deku from My Hero Academia split into three, Tanjiro, the kindness, Zenitsu, the cowardice with occasional bravery, and Inosuke, the part that caused Deku to continuously break his arms over and over. This would be fine if any of them actually had any development (getting stronger isn't character development by the way), but they were the same throughout the whole story, not a single ordeal changed any of them. Shounen fans made fun of moe fans for liking cute anime girls during cute things, yet went berserk over Nezuko, a bottom tier anime character with no personality, who barely passes as cute, who essentially, is just a cute anime girl doing cute things. Overall, horrible characters with horrible writing, nothing out of the ordinary for shounen to be honest.\n\nAnimation & Art: 10/10\n\nUfotable is well-known for amazing animation and art, Kimetsu no Yaiba is no exception to this rule, no matter how bad the actual content of the anime may be. Top of the line visuals and fight scenes, amazing CG, clean art, and amazingly done backgrounds/settings. Episode 19 broke the internet, and for damn good reason, it was a genuinely beautiful fight scene. Every good thing about this anime comes right from ufotable, as the actual show accomplishes nothing, which is something to note.\n\nSound: 7/10\n\nThe character voice acting was average. Zenitsu, Inosuke, and about half the characters had cripplingly annoying and bad voice acting, while the rest were pretty average/decent. The sound effects of the swords and the fighting were top tier, and beautifully done. Not much to be said here.\n\nEnjoyment: 2/10\n\nThe enjoyment of watching this show is equivalent to the enjoyment one would get chugging a litre of soy sauce. The only enjoyable thing about this show is the animation, and even then, it barely counteracts the atrocious story and writing. Frankly, this show was completely unnecessary, and probably drained some of the funds off of the new Heaven's Feel movie, so I enjoyed it even less, because it is probably lowering the quality of an actually good franchise.\n\nOverall: 4/10\n\nI wish I could give it a lower score, but anything lower than this would be an insult to ufotable's amazing work. I would never recommend this show to anyone, I will always laugh when I see the absurdly high score this show has, and I will consistently avoid Kimetsu fans on the internet, because they are the new My Hero Academia fans.\n\nTL;DR: I would rather be reincarnated as Umaru-chan's Onii-chan than ever watch this anime again.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Orion911,"b""\n                Strap yourself in for a rollercoaster of clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s, repetitive fights, and enough yelling to shatter glass. Demon Slayer is a show that throws every shounen trope in the blender, hits puree, and hopes you'll call it a smoothie.\n\nTanjiro, our protagonist, is about as original as a white t-shirt. Whining about his dead family and spouting generic lines about never giving up gets old faster than expired milk. Nezuko, his demon sister, is basically a silent prop with a kawaii box strapped to her back. The supporting cast is a mixed bag of annoying archetypes: the loud boar-head dude, the sleepy drool-fest, and the brooding emo\n                  ...\n          with a tragic backstory. Don't expect any character development beyond power-ups and bigger swords.\n\nThe plot? Paper thin. Demon slayers fight demons. Tanjiro cries about his family. Repeat. Rinse. Lather. The fights, while visually flashy, are all variations of the same dance: Tanjiro dodges, Nezuko gets captured, Tanjiro unleashes some flashy CGI move, demon explodes in a shower of purple goo. Rinse. Lather. Repeat.\n\nThe animation, admittedly, is pretty slick. But even the most stunning visuals can't distract from the repetitive story, predictable plot twists, and characters so flat they could be used as pizza boxes. The soundtrack is forgettable, except for the opening theme that gets stuck in your head like a bad earworm.\n\nDemon Slayer is like a cheap buffet: it looks appealing at first, but after a few bites, you're left feeling greasy and unsatisfied. If you're looking for a shounen anime with genuine innovation, complex characters, and a story that doesn't rehash the same tired tropes, steer clear of this one. You'll thank me later.\n\nBonus\n\nThe humor is forced and cringeworthy, like watching your grandpa try to do TikTok dances.\nThe pacing is all over the place, with long, boring stretches punctuated by rushed fight scenes.\nThe ending is predictable and unsatisfying, leaving you wondering if you wasted your time watching the whole thing.\n\nOverall: Demon Slayer is a flashy, soulless slog through tired tropes and predictable plotlines. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, the animation is mediocre at best, and the music will make you want to rip your ears off. Unless you enjoy melodrama, repetitive battles, and enough crying to fill a slayer's sake gourd, steer clear of this demon-infested disaster.\n              """,Demon Slayer
gabrielrroiz,"b'\n                Finally we have it, the new anime about loud teenagers with cool swords fighting the ultimate evil. Another shonen jump work which I ultimately like, but have a hard time describing the experience as not frustrating. So let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s get to that.\n\nThe animation and presentation are definitely a plus, containing beautiful 3d backgrounds, that are seamlessly implemented (for the most part). The composition and usage of color are great, setting the mood really well, making for a good ominous spooky atmosphere, which in turn, really brings to life the more melancholic tragic aspects of the story. Those only come into play when we finally see the\n                  ...\n          demons dying, sadly. The lament for these wretched creatures, lost to all love and humanity becoming really touching. More importantly the animation is fluid where it matters, the action scenes, the audience can always follow what is happening; feel the strikes and impacts of every blow, in those. So basically this looks sex. \n\nOh yeah, it also sounds sex. The music is phenomenal, impossible to find a mistake with. Every track seems to have a purpose, melody, also allowing for an entire new layer when added.  You can get the gist of a scene, the danger, peril, sadness excitement of moments, or whole sequences with the soundtrack alone. I would argue sometimes in terms of emotions, those are actually doing most of the job. Try and imagine episode 19 without the incredible track in the flashback, or the rush for the final strike. You would have a completely different fight (and a way more boring one). In terms of translating the Kimetsu no Yaiba\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s story into anime, there is definitely a lot of work in crafting this show, which is shown in every episode (not mob psycho levels, but it sure is up there with the best).\n\nIn terms of narrative, it also contains some cool stuff. It understands the appeal of modern shonen, those are usually short and direct to the point. Borrowing a lot of elements and inspiration from classics in the genre, but making for a breezier, better-paced viewing. Which I would argue is great in a genre where pulpy action and excitement are 90% of the appeal (though Yaiba moves way too fast a lot of the time). Also, there is always a good sense of progression, getting slowly larger in scope, the story allowing for constantly bigger threats and enemies. I do think the show handles the whole slowly developing for a larger narrative with dozen characters, and world ending stakes somewhat neatly.\n\nUnfortunately, there was a lot that stopped me from completely buying to the emotions of this melodramatic and exciting tale. The characters were the issue for the most part, needing a more elaborate development in several key moments. The first episode is infamous in that regard, for killing the protagonist family in the middle of its run, while giving our main 3 scenes interacting with them. On this specific situation we find the protagonist motivation, the fact he lost everything of value, while gaining determination to save his sister and fight demons.  But it feels like more of an afterthought, irrelevant, because we barely know this character, or have any grasp on the relations displayed, and bam, they die. Understanding the protagonist is essential, we need to see what he loves, get true action and moments with those people, see that family and discover why they were something to die for. The entire basis of the series relies on the Nezuko \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Tanjirou bond, the thing it needs to nail more than anything. However, the introduction blows it pretty well.\n\nThe issue of never managing to land, the big importance character moments and interaction, is prevalent. There are some obvious shortcuts attempted, like both Zenitsu and Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s main fight in the anime, rely on a memory of an important father figure. Detail, we were not aware those characters even existed before the conflict of the episode started, and their whole appearance in the narrative is through flashbacks where they say important information. These interactions and supposedly super important people have no weight, or purpose, only serving for exposition. The lack of development is almost disturbing, just try and give such appearances relevance before putting them as devices to move plot. Try and think of episode 19 without the music, suddenly there is not much to care.\nNarratives inevitably become more complicated, entangled plotlines more common, complexity only tends to rise with progression. In turn this makes the need for a strong foundation really pressing, especially in the shonen genre, one infamous for introducing dozens of new characters per arc. Yaiba is giving strong signs of branching off, as lots of new super relevant people have been introduced. Nevertheless, I cannot trust our main party to hold interest at the center stage.\n\nMy boy, Tanjirou, is probably the best of a character this show has, and even him does not hold that well on his own.  Sure I may love way too good for this world boys, filled with kindness, comprehension, focus on always attempting to do what is best for the world, with everything he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s got. It may be impossible to not grow attached with the guy, seeing the lengths of effort displayed, the entire journey revolving around saving loved ones, and even more surprisingly, the own demons he uses that blade against. Goodness just comes so naturally for him, acts of helping, trying to understand, while also putting everything on the line for others, they just hit me right in the feels.\n\nNevertheless, no matter how much I love his nature, there is something lacking, which comes in the almost nonexistent challenges. The ideals and what Tanjirou represents are never meaningfully contradicted, and he never experiences much in terms of failure.  The ideals are too perfect, and come pretty much unscathed through the course of the story. This means he is not given much to react to, and learn from the world, or adversaries presented.  Conflict mostly comes from external, physical barriers only there to be surpassed, but are not really that meaningful or memorable. While somehow everyone else features way worst when hold to scrutiny.\n\nAnother issue comes from how Kimetsu no Yaiba is not really developing most of the concepts presented.  The anime wants to have this tragic depressing side, where the demons are representations to some of humanity deepest anxieties, and desires, perverted on these loveless creatures. All the while denying to develop, and add human characteristics for the demons through most of their appearances. Giving the whole weight of characterization, humanity through flashbacks is a really roundabout way of adding the idea. Especially when they happen just when the character is dying, i.e., there is no more conflict, i.e., they do not matter anymore.  The contrast, between the man eating monster at the surface, and human nature in the core, is barely allowed time, proper position, to shine, and make room for conflicted feelings towards the adversaries.  The fact those are inflicted souls suffering is here, but portrayed in an addendum like manner, which feels related to nothing. \n\nThe same wasted potential can be seen on the emphasis the show gives to the importance of empathy. Shown in the signs of it wanting us to understand and care for these creatures, their humanity and existences are not objects of pity, indifference, rage, but are of worth, deserve to be respected, and ultimately acknowledged. Humans and demons alike deserve compassion, someone who will attempt to understand their pains, try and help, Tanjirou being in the role of always doing this. Nevertheless, the concept is never given relevance in the narrative, our characters never win because of understanding the demon, the knowledge of who they were as people is in effect, made practically useless. Despite the importance of bounds, helping the weak and afflicted, being something hard to deny, Kimetsu no Yaiba does not have a particularly meaningful thing to say, or topic to explore, regarding such point\n\nConcluding, Kimetsu no Yaiba might be an action spectacle at times, with plenty of fun moments and interactions, which I would overall recommend. There were some reasons I could never completely embark in this mostly comfy show, about an impossibly good natured kid. Go for Mob Psycho for a way more interesting version of such, but you are probably going to have a better experience than me.\n              '",Demon Slayer
BropixWuff,"b'\n                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is a historical, action-sh\xc3\x85\xef\xbf\xbdnen, supernatural manga written and illustrated by Gotouge Koyoharu. Adapted into an anime series by the immensely talented Studio Ufotable. The studio behind the successful anime adaptions of Type Moon\'s series: Fate and Kara no Kyoukai.\n\nDemon Slayer has taken the world by storm, the series has exploded in popularity, with manga sales exceeding 100+ million within a year\'s time. While the anime is being recognized as a classic.\n\nSet within the Taish\xc3\x85\xef\xbf\xbd period of Japan, young Kamado Tanjiro inspires to become a ""Demon Slayer"", pursuing a path of vengeance for the murder of his family committed by a\n                  ...\n          demon, while also trying to find a cure for his younger sister Nezuko, who turned into a demon.\n\nIf you hate sh\xc3\x85\xef\xbf\xbdnen troupes and sh\xc3\x85\xef\xbf\xbdnen anime in general, this series won\'t really change your opinion. But if you look past that you will find an anime with a simple, but wonderful story, great episode direction, some of the best animation you will ever see, and some of the best voice acting and music.\n\nUfotable\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s adaption is the best anime adaption I have ever seen. An adaption few authors could ever hope to receive. An adaption that is not only better than its source material, but it also enhances the experience in a multitude of layers, ways the manga was never able to achieve. The manga still has a solid story, but suffers from less than impressive artwork, direction, and page layout. While the adaption improves upon the content of the manga while enhancing every other quality.\n\nAt its core, it is a battle sh\xc3\x85\xef\xbf\xbdnen. The fights featured are wonderfully animated, superbly directed, fluid, and contain an appealing art style fitting the series. The strength of the fights lay behind the main antagonists, the demons. They are simply monsters that go out of their way to kill a multitude of people, to feast on their flesh while having no remorse or humanity.\n\nOr so that is how you are supposed to view them. But demons were all originally human, turned demon against their wills, suffering from painful hunger, turning violent with their humanity fading away, being portrayed as misfortunate people.\n\nTanjiro is a very standard sh\xc3\x85\xef\xbf\xbdnen protagonist, he\'s the hard-working type, has an unusual great sense of smell, and has a variety of comedic quirks. The main aspect of his character is his incredibly kind nature, despite this, he shows no mercy towards demons, and makes no exceptions to beheading one. He essentially kills them in order to ""save"" them, as funny as it sounds.\n\nThe Demons he cuts down reveal details about their past lives, eventually coming to regret what they became. While Tanjiro can never forgive their actions of killing innocent people, he still shows sympathy and sends them off to rest. Generally, to deliver this type of message, you would need an overly kind character like Tanjiro, as not many characters could reasonably show sympathy to a cannibalistic monster. While his character is very cliche it is perfect for the series.\n\nTanjiro an immensely strong bond with his younger sister Nezuko. One of the themes pushed by Demon Slayer is family, their relationship feels genuine and sweet throughout the anime.\n\nThe other characters have room to grow, but seeing as only 1/4th of the source material has been adapted, there is still plenty of growth to come. They have their share of quirky personalities and great designs, while each having an appropriate amount of screen time. I am excited to see how they progress, as well as other minor characters.\n\nDemon Slayer has been one of the most enjoyable anime I have watched in a while, for what it is, it\'s amazing. Such a perfect blend of great animation of music, with a wonderful story that tackles its themes with flawless execution. While certainly not a perfect series, for the time being, I giving Demon Slayer a 10/10.\n              '",Demon Slayer
bustatunez,"b'\n                Anime is as much a visual genre as it is one centered around storytelling. But when one of those two things are prioritized over the other rather than treated as two halves to a whole, the work in question suffers. At around episode 14--as the artwork was becoming commonplace--I decided to stop binging the anime and analyze why it had become so boring and silly to me.\n\nDemon Slayer (DS) rehashes a story that we\'re all accustomed to. There is the status quo which gets interrupted by a tragedy (the catalyst), and then The Hero is thrown into a series of events to become ""stronger"" with\n                  ...\n          the help of supernatural aid. The Monomyth (commonly known as The Hero\'s Journey) has been around for millenia; it\'s the focal point of thousands of stories. And yet, despite DS\'s lavish praise from fans, it does nothing new with the Monomyth. The series just follows the formula to a T. And if DS takes no risks with its storytelling, then it becomes easy to predict. Yes, Tanjiro gets into harrowing fights, but he\'s never in any real danger. He has plot armor. And timeskip level ups. Hence, if the series remains adherent to the typical Monomyth, then Tanjiro never will be in any actual trouble. He\'ll always win because of deus ex machina and finally save Nezuko, return home, ""save the day,"" etc. \n\nOn that note, the whole inclusion of Nezuko is a waste. I know that sounds harsh, but hear me out: she\'s only there to serve as an emotional incentive for Tanjiro, but since their relationship is never established beyond some headpatting and smiling and tears, we never get a real sense of why Tanjiro is fighting for her. Wasn\'t their family being killed enough of an incentive already to go out and behead some evil creatures? ""But, blood is thicker than water!"" you say. Sure, but this is a story, not real life. The viewership knows nothing of Tanjiro\'s relationship with Nezuko beyond an impossibly blissful flashback in episode 1, and now that she\'s become half-demon, she\'s changed, so who\'s to say that her actions in this altered form reflect her old self? What even is her old self? An unreal feminine ideal? It\'s unknown. Sure, she\'s the last living woman of her family and just *might* succumb to her demony side (golly!), but what else is there to her character besides ""You attacked family so I angry and kick your head in"" or ""I\'m tired and go to sleep, hold hand please""? Yes, she fawns over people as though they\'re her own family members to prove to us that she\'s such a loving person, but even that\'s fake because of Sensei\'s magic spell. It\'s weak characterization. She does fight, but only when it\'s convenient to the plot so that Tanjiro\'s plot armor looks more believable. In the end, she\'s there to make us feel some ""deeper"" connection to Tanjiro\'s plight. ""Poor Nezuko, I hope she returns to being a human again and living happily ever after! Btw, she\'s a pretty girl, so now I want that even more."" How cliche. And that\'s how the series tries to hook you: by appealing to your emotions at every turn possible. Emotions are blinding--so blinding that you\'re willing to ignore a weak story if you ""feel"" something for different characters. Shonen like One Piece and Naruto usually know how to time their emotional appeals, at least. Even shorter series like Bebop know how to do this well. DS doesn\'t know when to let up with trying to tug at your heartstrings, and thusly it ends up coming across as forced rather than natural.\n\nIt\'s not even an issue that Nezuko is a silent protagonist, because in the video game Transistor, this same idea is executed, but executed well. By the end of the story, you have a clear idea of who Red (the silent female) is and who she used to be. Nezuko\'s range of expression is limited not only because she doesn\'t talk, but because she\'s not allowed to develop beyond her few responses to things. Someone online asked why doesn\'t she just write things down to communicate, which was met by someone saying that was ""fallacious criticism."" Ha! Tanjiro can write, but his sister can\'t? Demons can talk and communicate, don\'t give me that bull.\n\nThe other characters aren\'t much better. Tanjiro is your usual happy-go-lucky shonen idiot (with a weird, unexplained sniffing power like Gon Freecs) forced to ""grow up"" because of circumstances, and the others are caricatures of tropes we\'ve already seen hundreds of times in anime (the cowardly retard, the strong retard, the stoic retard, the girl-looking man retard, the mature older sister type, the bad Japanese humor, etc). They all act in bizarre ways as though they don\'t really know how human interaction works (they don\'t). This is fine for people who never get tired of seeing wacky Japanese archetypes being awkward, but if you\'re looking for a creative spin on those types, then keep on looking.\n\nAlso, why does an anime predicated on the theme of family show such a shallow portrayal of it? There were so many opportunities for some great character development that was squandered by the pacing and appearances of silly demons coming at the hero. And, come to think of it, why aren\'t there more demon fighters in the world if people are getting devoured or ""turned"" so frequently? Then there\'s the whole deal with them copying Tokyo Ghoul\'s ideas, which were copied from Parasyte, which copied it from elsewhere, etc, etc. I\'m not saying that that type of story can\'t be retold, but when you take inspiration from sources that are already diluted, you\'re going to end up with a weak product. \n\nThere are far, far better stories out there to read or watch that deal with DS\'s same themes but do it in a much better way (Parasyte, Berserk, Castlevania, HxH). DS stopped impressing me once the shininess of its visuals wore off and I quickly became disenchanted with what I was watching: a story that I\'d already experienced before, albeit worse, with animation used to overcompensate for its insipid storytelling. Unlike some other shonen where the mangaka understands how verisimilitude works, DS fakes depth with its characters rather than working toward something meaningful and believable. Studios nowadays realize that shallow appeals to emotion and sugoi animation = profit, that\'s why great stories are few and far between now: standards have dropped to such a low that stuff like DS is managing to amaze people. It\'s an amalgamation of every bad shonen in recent times (Attack on Titan, Seven Deadly Sins, Fairy Tail, Tokyo Ghoul, Pandora Hearts, Hero Academia, etc) fused with the feudal Japan aesthetic and pointless inclusions of gore for that good ol\' pseudo-seinen shock value. Anime of DS\'s kind try to hijack your emotional intelligence and win your allegiance; it\'s textbook manipulation. \n\nSure, it feels nice to be psychologically attached to something, but if you go turning off your ability to criticize or analyze something you like or dislike, then you\'ve stopped thinking clearly about said thing and have let it sway your emotions and decision-making capabilities. I say this only because I see so many fans lose it and curse out anyone who says something even remotely negative about their beloved Demon Slayer. Well, now I can see why they like this anime so much. But, as someone I know once said, ""fandoms are a wildfire.""\n\nThat\'s all I\'ve got to say. I\'m out.\n              '",Demon Slayer
TheDiamondBro,"b""\n                (CONTAINS SPOILERS)\n\nDemon Slayer is an anime about a kid named Tanjiro that had his family killed by a demon but only one of his family members lived and that was his sister Nezuko. Tanjiro is out with revenge to kill the person who killed almost all of his family by passing any obstacle that comes his way like getting his sister bitten to a bloody nightmare or fighting to survive. The narrative isn't the best thing in the world but at least its something enjoyable.\n.\nAnimation: When it comes to animation the show has a lot to offer. I swear to you every frame is a\n                  ...\n          masterpiece. The character design in each main and side character is unique in its own way. Sometimes its stiff in frames but it can't all be perfect. The detail for everything like the hair and houses is wonderful. But I wish I would say the same thing with the character development.\n\nCharacter Development: The shows characters are kind of poorly made and rushed. They do what a lot of Shonen anime do, when someone's in a middle of fight they just say there tragic backstory like growing up I got older and struggled with fighting or something like that. But the real problem I have with characters is that they all just have own personality trait and they make the worst of it. Like Zenistu, all he does is just cry and yell and he does that with just obsolete territory. But they can't all be perfect. But there's this one character that is amazingly well done. And that is the antagonist, Muzan Kibutsuji. You love him and you love to hate him. He may not have that much screen time but he is an amazing character when he does have screen time.\n\nPlot/Story: They plot to this show is okay, so far in this season the main character in this is just going on missions. The try to make the last arc of the season be special and it kinda worked. But it just felt like every Shonen anime when they do a fight or arc.  But at least we got a good fight and a nice backstory of Tanjore's dad. At first it was going for its own style of show, but the director was just like nah lets do what everyone does. This shows plot had a lot of creative potential but through some of it away but kept a good junk of it so it could be popular. But the story is still entertainingly well done.\n\nMusic/ Soundtrack: The music in this show is outstanding. You can tell they put time and effort it the music. Who ever picked the opening and made the shows music you have a good taste. I swear the end of the fight between Tanjiro vs that spider demons soundtrack was so incredibly calming. It had a good touch to the end of that fight. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but lets get real hear, you have to at least enjoy it a little bit.\n\nWriting: The shows writing is pretty fine. It's good but not bad, its one of those things. I got to admit the person who writes for the wart hog for a head guy is a good writer. That wart hog dude is second to main the antagonist in the show. All in all, the writing is good enough.\n\nCGI: This anime has CGI and for anime we all know how that turns out. But this show does it well. I haven't seen CGI in anime this good. I would say they do it better than Vinland Saga. I think Demon Slayer is one of the first animas that have done CGI non-poorly. They even use it in their fights. They mix good animation with CGI, something that has probably never been done before in a incredible way. Trust me you will not be unconfterbale when you look at the CGI.\n\n\nI recommend this show to people who love adventure and combat with swords. But I wouldn't highly recommended it. If you have nothing to watch you should take a look at this.\n              """,Demon Slayer

I am kinda new to this reviewing thing so go easy on me hehe. \n\nDemon Slayer is what it was hyped up to be and I am glad I got what I wanted out of this anime. Going into the anime I recognized most of the characters as I got spoiled on social media a bit but it didn't matter. All that matters to me is the story behind the anime and the characters if you get my jist. The tales of Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko Kamado, Inosuke\n                  ...\n          Hashibira, and Zenitsu Agatsuma are quite enjoyable throughout the 26 episodes. \n\nStory 9/10\nThe main story of Demon Slayer is very good and I enjoyed watching it go throughout the series. Having an older brother have his family killed except his sister turned demon was not what I was expecting to be honest. With the assistance of Inosuke, Zenitsu, and many others. Tanjiro and Nezuko push forward in slaying the demon responsible for killing his family. I really liked how this story went from a horrific horror at the start to some of a comedy throughout the anime! (I like comedy anime a lot! As they tend to appeal to me more).\n\nArt 9/10\nI liked the art style throughout the anime and the colours as well. The animation was really impressive as with the fight scenes as well. There are some parts of the anime's comedy that I was not expecting but enjoyed as well! \n\nSound 8/10\nThe voice acting for the dub was quite good and Inosuke (voiced by my favourite VA Bryce Papenbrook) was my favourite of the voices by far. The voices of the anime characters are quite exceptional with a few of them here and there having some eh moments. \n\nCharacter 9/10\nThe characters are shown well as Tanjiro being the one who wants justice for the murder of his family to  Zenitsu's cowardness and to Inosuke's hard-headedness. The expressions shown with these characters throughout the anime are quite exceptional in my opinion. \n\nEnjoyment 9/10\nI enjoyed this anime very much through the days I've watched this and I hope this review among many others helped anyone with their view of Kimetsu no Yaiba or Demon Slayer!\n              """,Demon Slayer
vkmlia,"b'\n                I rarely like shounen protagonists. They\'re usually ""dumb"", noisy, self-centered, ambitious, somehow inapt, don\'t seem to know how to deal with feelings... which is boring to me. Tanjiro\'s different.  He\'s sweet, caring, and is not after some big thing for himself. He reminds me a bit of Kenshin, from Rurouni Kenshin. And it\'s not only him! Other characters in Demon Slayer have been/are being developed this wayl: Urokodaki, the leader of the Demon Slayers, Tomioka in his own way... To me this is a plus. I love to see male and female characters go out of their traditional roles, because this way I can\n                  ...\n          actually identify with them.\n\nThe contemplative moments are just incledible, imo. You know, the pauses where we can actually breath after the action and enjoy the amazing scenery. Ghibli movies do it beautifully and I Think Demon Slayer does it too. And I love the moments where we are in Tanjiro\'s mind.\n\nWhich brings me to the one thing which I think is a REALLY put-off: Zenitsu and Inosuke. They are SO noisy and repetitive. All that peace and contemplation goes away when they appear. But they\'re having their share of development, so I really hope it gets better with time.\n\nOutstanding animation and sound, I don\'t think I even have to comment on that. Top-tier. Nice gory/horror moments.  Tanjiro definitely does not flinch before taking a demon\'s head or makes a fuss because of his compassion. The characters actually get injuried to the point that they can\'t fight. Those things add up to Incledible high-stakes battles.\n\nTo me, the words for the script/dialogues seem hand-picked, because it\'s neither excessive nor lacking: just perfect for the moments in question and what they want to achieve (exceptions are Zenitsu and Inosuke, of course). And there are moments where no words are needed. For example, the anime doesn\'t keep stating how great the main character is - It shows you, in beautiful ways.\n\nThe plot is simple and easy to follow. I\'m the one to like complicated plot lines, but I was surprised to see how a simple but well done development can get you so involved. No good animation that can compensate shallow characters and poor development, I\'ve seen this time and time, because you and up asking yourself in the middle of it: seriously? all this prodution for this? Demon Slayer is not like that. It\'s getting a lot of hate because of the ""overhype"". Is it the GOAT shonen? NO, IT\'S NOT. But it\'s great, and I think we have to do it justice.\n\nTo me, the keyword to define Demon Slayer is ""involving"". It\'s that thing that the sum is bigger than its parts. It\'s dark, beautiful, simple, well made, with relatable character and key moments that get you seriously hooked. To me it\'s enjoable through and through.\n              '",Demon Slayer
iSakuraSnow,"b""\n                Demon Slayer had me shooked from the very first episode. Tanjirou went home to find out that his whole family had been slaugtered, and the sole survivor, his little sister Nezuko, had became a demon. What is worse is that Tomioka caught on that there was a new demon on the loose so he tried to kill her. But of course, we were given a VERY epic scene where Tanjirou used his smarts to defeat Tomioka. Ever since that first episode, I was hooked.\n\nDemon Slayer is not the typical shounen/action anime. Yes, there's going to be a new demon that Tanjirou. or another demon slayer.\n                  ...\n          would end up defeating. However, the artsy effects that they use to portray every single move never fails to impress me. The sounds of clashing swords and water make the whole experience even more entrancing. \n\nBut Demon Slayer is not only about fights either. We have an amazing main protagonist who is so wholesome, always there for his friends and especially his sister. He started off weak but had potential, and we see him literally go through training to become the amazing character he ended up being in the last episode. Tanjirou eventually teams up with Zenitsu and Inosuke, and they seemed whack at first, but as we watch this go through their own personal journeys, you realize that they are actually really cool too.\n\nWith that being said, I definitely recommend Demon Slayer, and I am so glad that I picked it up this season. I only recently checked the reviews/ratings/rankings for Demon Slayer, and it shook me even more that it has a whopping 8.92/10, making it ranked #20 of all time. I cannot wait for the movie to come out, and I hope season 2 comes out soon.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Emenalus,"b'\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba is definitely one of the most popular titles to be released in the anime industry in the recent years, especially due to its beautiful animations and visuals. However, just like with every anime, such popularity also comes with high expectations from viewers who pick up the anime based on this fact - they expect to see an anime that is near perfection in all of its aspects and one could never raise a finger about any of the discrepancies. \n\nWhat I\'m referring to is the amount of unnecessary hate Kimetsu no Yaiba has received for having seemingly lackluster story and/or bad writing.\n                  ...\n          While this might be the case when we\'re looking at some of the more popular titles that focus on mystery or storytelling, like Steins;Gate, people seem to forget that Kimetsu no Yaiba never had its focus set on one of these concepts. Instead, the anime markets itself as a shounen anime, and as someone who has watched a dozen of titles in the same genre, I can say that in comparison it is vastly superior.\n\nWhat I can personally say about the story is that while it might not be the most revolutionizing story you might find in the market, simplicity is NOT the same as bad writing. Instead, I think this is one of the charms that Kimetsu no Yaiba has: A story of a boy whose family was murdered while he was away, and his sister gets turned into a demon. However, his sister still seems to have some humanity left in her and so the boy strives to become a demon slayer to cure his sister. That is basically the entire story summarized, and while it might not look like much, it sets a strong foundation with a clear goal that just about anyone is capable of following. Additionally, in comparison to the usual shounen anime, the anime doesn\'t rely on keeping its viewers entertained with fanservice or surrounding the main protagonist with chicks, but with the sole anticipation of seeing him grow as a warrior.\n\nIt might be debatable whether the anime could\'ve included something more to make the anime stand out as something particularly unique, but keeping up a staple in the genre keeps the anime consistent and doesn\'t leave much risk in making the story too messy. After seeing a few titles go too far and basically ruin themselves in the process, I am relieved that Kimetsu no Yaiba has decided to stand on its own roots.\n\nHowever, that doesn\'t mean that the anime doesn\'t have a couple misconceptions, which is the reason why I refrained to give this anime a full 10. While my standards for giving a 10 are quite high, it is also a fact that even Kimetsu no Yaiba falls into some of the usual mistakes that shounen anime tend to make. While this might be to linearize storytelling and keep the juicy action going, there was a couple things I would\'ve liked to see being promoted a little more to give a better understanding of how Demon Slayers as an organization function. \n\nQuite near the beginning of the anime, you are given the information that demon slayers consist of ten ranks. However, I won\'t even bother remembering what they are since the anime tells them to you only once. Ever since then, one of the things I eventually wanted to see was Tanjirou earning a promotion. Maybe have his little messenger raven tell him that his actions have been recognized and therefore he\'s given something extra for doing a good job. Unfortunately, this never happens and it remains a mystery how good he actually is. While it might be the case that he just hasn\'t become good enough, considering the achievements that he made over the course of the anime and how much better he is compared to other Mizunotos (lowest rank in the organization), I half expected him to be at least somewhat recognized. However, this remains to be unknown until someone of a higher rank (other than the highest) is clearly introduced in the anime. \n\nThe other problem I had with the anime was in the first half and it was the fact that Tanjirou was basically just doing missions after another for ten episodes and no bigger development was introduced until after. This leaves a lot to be desired in regard of world building, and I figure that this section could\'ve been improved by, once again, adding a little more about the Demon Slayer organization. While seeing him improve as a warrior was amusing by itself and introducing a couple new characters imperative to his mission saving his sister was relieving, to me personally this isn\'t enough to satisfy my curiosity about what kind of an entity Tanjirou is working for. An excuse like ""Go read the manga"" isn\'t going to justify the fact that some things could\'ve been worked on in the anime a little bit better, and considering the anime was running for 25 episodes instead of the usual 12, there was more than enough space for more information like this. There\'s a fine line between keeping a constant sense of mystery in the background and just being overly secretive, and from my personal view this discrepancy represents the latter.\n\nOverall, Kimetsu no Yaiba is a very consistent title in the shounen genre that will most likely be remembered for years to come. I don\'t follow on any news myself, but if it hasn\'t been announced already, I am pretty sure that a second season will be introduced due to its explosive popularity. While the anime might not be a work of perfection on its own with a few flaws, these are quite minor in the bigger picture and in comparison to other shounen titles, it is more refined and much more interesting to watch. If you\'re an avid shounen anime viewer yourself, this is something you must watch.\n              '",Demon Slayer
OtAkU_TaBiB,"b""\n                This anime is TBH one of the best action anime i've ever seen. Demon Slayer has quite a good plot and basically i will say the success behind this anime is it's artstyle and the OST and Opening song. Like when they gave the opening song as BG song in ep 19 and even in the last episode. They  almost made an AMV in ep 26 :3\n\nDemon Slayer is an anime where it is the timeline of Demons and the master of all the demon is Kibutsuji Muzan. Kamado Tanjiro is the Main protagonist of this anime who has lost his whole family at\n                  ...\n          once by demon attack and her sister Nezuko has turned into a demon but it is a matter of wonder that being a demon his sister is supporting the Demon Slayers and she doesn't need to eat human flesh to survive which is rather extremely rare.\n\nI will say the action, artstyle, storyline, character development, enjoyment and everything is top-notch. I will not say this is the best anime out there but i will rather say that this is one of the best action anime which deserves to take place in Top 10 action anime. Ufotable is an unknown and infamous studio. Making such an anime is obviously their revolutionary success. Infact, this studio hasn't even make an anime which ranked among top 500 (no offense). Hoping high from this studio. Just show this world what you guys can make (a good example of their artwork is episode 19. Just go check that episode out. That episode has even broke a server of Kissanime)\n\nThis anime is a story of these two youngsters becoming the top demon slayers by also getting support from two of there friends- Zenitsu and Inosuke. Their main showdown is between the demon slayer corps VS the Muzan team. Getting apart defeating Muzan, the demon slayer corps can't even cross paths with him and it is even hard for them to defeat the twelve demon moons.  Will they be able to do it? A rather tough question to say. Check this anime out to see what will be the consequences, This anime has already become famous world wide and the manga has already ended ( my request to new starters is that don't take spoilers from manga. This anime is intense. It will ruin your enjoyment.)\n\nHoping high from the upcoming seasons. Let's beat Kimi no Nawa and become the highest grossing movie of all time : Kimetsu no Yaiba: mugen Resha-hen. :)\n              """,Demon Slayer
UnorthoDon,"b'\n                (MINOR SPOILERS [I guess])\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba or better known as Demon Slayer... This anime has been one of the best I have ever seen. Woah, hold it! Don\'t criticize me just yet! Let me explain.\n\nThe Story - The story is pretty simple. As you all know, Tanjiro\'s family is murdered by a demon and his sister is turned into one and all that kind of stuff. The story throughout is simple. Does that mean it is bad? NO! Just because it is simple doesn\'t make it BAD! I have seen many shows and movies (not all them anime by the way) that tried to be\n                  ...\n          complex that I sometimes end up even more confused than I was before. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\'t. This show has a clear story that everyone can follow. I just wish it was a bit more complex and that they may be fleshed out Tanjiro\'s family a bit more. 8/10\n\nThe Art - I don\'t know what else to say. The art and animation are SUPERB.  The fight scenes are absolutely beautiful. The CGI is seamlessly integrated into the animation. I have to double back many times during the show to say, ""Wait, that was CGI?"" Ufotable did an absolutely wonderful job animated this. And that one scene.. Yes, you know THAT ONE SCENE.... ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! Definitely deserves a 10/10 for art right there.\n\nThe Sound - The sound was also just as good. I feel like each voice was perfect for each of the characters. And the music... wow, the music is underrated in the show. Many people talk about how AMAZING the animation is... and it is but the music needs the spotlight as well. The opening by LiSA... is amazing. All the other pieces of music are just as great! It clearly sets the tone for each fight scene. Definitely 10/10. \n\nThe Characters - The characters of the show are pretty enjoyable. None of them feel out of place and each of them is great together. There is plenty of character growth and not of it feels forced or too fast.  The characters themselves aren\'t too complex (for right now) but again that doesn\'t mean it is bad. I would give the characters a 9/10\n\nOverall, the show was a pleasure to watch. It was visually pleasing, the fights were exhilarating and at times heartbreaking, and the story was clear and simple to follow. Overall, I would give it a 10/10. Despite some really minor mistakes, it was absolutely phenomenal. I know not everyone would agree with me about this, but it is fine. This  is just how I felt about the show.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Speytex,"b""\n                Ugly CGI, bland villains, bland one-dimensional characters, bland story/plot, braindead fights that are decided by Le Strong anime attack, and horrendously loud unfunny anime funnies with characters screeching at each other. So the story sucks, the characters suck, the action sucks, the visuals suck and the humor sucks. I really don't know how this blew up. It is the definition of painfully mid to the fullest extent. The only fight that had some sort of smart outplay and tension was the very first encounter in the forest. The stakes were high, and the matter was urgent, plus Tanjirou thinking fast on how to use the\n                  ...\n          Axt right was pretty cool. Anything beyond that point is wasted potential. I have to admit one thing that really stands out here is the character designs, they are incredible. Seriously, even a rock has twice the amount of character design you'll find anywhere else. It is one of the very few anime where it is hard to spot the main character with all these unique looking designs. So yeah, overall the ultimate Normie anime, maybe thats why its so popular\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\xc3\xb0\xc5\xb8\xc2\xa4\xe2\x80\x9d\n              """,Demon Slayer
ScienceLover,"b""\n                In my opinion, Kimetsu no Yaiba is one the most shallow but over-hyped animes I have ever watched. Every time I watched an episode, I was always expecting some improvement to unfold on the next one (it's ufotable's bro). Sadly, it never happened and I ended up wasting my time finishing the whole episodes for this season with a big disappointment.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the animation and sound for Kimetsu no Yaiba are arguably one of the best out there. However, art and sound alone are weak components to make an anime worth watching. Some animes with poor animation such as Kemono Friends and Kemurikusa,\n                  ...\n          which happen to be from the same studio Yaoyorozu, are far more enjoyable to me than this piece of half baked anime. In fact, I consider Kemono Friends as a master piece.\n\nFinishing the whole season of Kimetsu no Yaiba makes me wonder where does all the hype for Kimetsu no Yaiba come from? Or is it just me?\n              """,Demon Slayer
Ethan_07,"b""\n                'Demon Slayer is a work of art, which feasts on both the eyes and the heart.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2\n\nIt embraced absorbing sword styles that dance on each other; breathtaking scores that are both fierce and gentle; colorful characters in their design and personalities; daunting blend of shounen and historical genre; elegant portrayal of memories and death and a touching bond depicting a desperate brother that only want to protect his little sister. It is not confined to one particular aspect to makes that it so great, so absorbing, breathtaking, colorful, daunting, elegant and touching. With this harmonic blend, it gives rise to one of the greatest scenes anime\n                  ...\n          has ever pulled off in its whole history because to make up that moment, it takes in everything.\n\nDemon Slayer is so overwhelming because of this one extra push that impacts the whole shounen genre itself. This gives a big slap of realization to show the world that even with typical shounen plot that recycles on training and killing demons, the best of the characters can still be brought out. This is the power of great storytelling. It breaks generic main characters out from their frame to be more than they are supposed to and it links a family bond in ways we didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t expect, as it did with the chemistry created with boar-headed Inosuke, crybaby Zenitsu and other side characters. It presented determination and the resolve of the characters to be more than last-minute shouts and magical flashbacks but actually approach the danger at hand with what they can do instead of what they can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t.\n\nTanjirou, is an innocent and kind character without the naivety. He was brought into the world of slaying demons with harsh lifestyle that he knew nothing off, but this doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t take away his core of kindness. This is why he is the most efficient character in bringing out the best of others, be his foes or friends. His passionate actions inspire others and his genuine words ring so true that anyone can feel the despair and anger he has. The voice actor, Natsuki Hanae knows this feels and he nailed it. Along Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s side is the criminally cute Nezuko. She fiercely protects her brother and other humans who she sees as her family members. Despite losing a portion of her emotions and memories, she doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t forget the bond forged with her family members and this shines brightly when they support each other. \n\nAlso, she could shrink to fit inside a box.\n\nThen there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the drama king Zenitsu with the voice actor that sounds like he is the one having most fun with his whining, never-ending shouts and non-stopping complains. He is the most immature character that brings in laughter and seriousness in different scenarios, but the most thoughtful and realistic character when it comes to protecting a friend and facing death at its doorsteps. In essence, he is a scaredy-cat that runs and cries but he never gives up. This is one of the traits that makes him so likeable and when he sleeps, the real fun begins. Inosuke, on the other hand is a bit air-headed, who always scream and fight while trying to understand others\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 feelings. Despite his relentlessness, he could calmly evaluate the situation, someone you can count on (sometimes). There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s also the mature Tomioka, a masterful swordsman with no friends.\n\nThe main highlight of Demon Slayer is the unbreakable bond shared by Tanjiro and his sister, which is finally not sexualized in any way. It is this bond that add in the sympathy element in demons Tanjiro slained, because he understands that they were once human too, like his sister. This changes how he deals with demons personally, and it gives us a better insight on his determination to protect others. He can evoke their tragic flashbacks with his compassion so that we could empathize them to an extent. To understand their bittersweet stories and how a sad-happy face could look so mesmerizing.\n\nAdding to the merit points are the comedic scenes with the sudden change of art style, presenting trivial moments as something silly. Along with the witty dialogue and sudden change of voice intonation of voice actors, the warm interaction of the characters are better portrayed and make us want to join in as well. Action drives the show, but it is this comedy that makes it much more ridiculously entertaining.\n\nThe animation is handled by ufotable, which enhanced just about everything. Renowned for their work in Fate franchise, the fighting scenes are a charm with the use of engaging camera and transitions especially when each character has their unique elemental sword styles with various breathing techniques. The producers improvised these flashy movements that stacked one after another by adding weight to the hits landed to present a smooth flow. The characters\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 facial expressions also played a major role for moments of resonance, with some accurately depicting the smile of kindness Tanjiro shows, a cold lonely look on Sabito\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s face and the completely frightened Zenitsu. Everything, under their touch becomes a radiant mix of color playing well on each other.\n\nThe scores set up the ambience perfectly.  LiSA, once again composed amazing OP and ED with their own recognizable rising beats and J-rock rhythms from Sword Art Online and Fate franchise. The pitch and sound works nicely with the fade of samurai-like-music, accompanying echoes of choir that keep us at the edge of our seat. But, it is the ending song \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xcb\x9cKamado Tanjiro no Uta\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 from episode 19 that really put the all the songs in Demon Slayer into a perspective and it plays off as the greatest orchestral climax. A soft and gentle beat that reached its height exponentially and bring back the theme of Demon Slayer \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c an innocent boy just trying to protect his sister. This is the most impactful and touching message that it left to all the audiences.\n\nOverall, Demon Slayer is more than great execution of plot, stunning visual effects, cinematic soundtracks and playful interaction between the characters. Demon Slayer, tells the tale of how people connects and within the connection, some bonds can never be shattered. Demon Slayer is, a work of art.\n              """,Demon Slayer
chaoticjunk,"b""\n                this review is simply for my enjoyment i am analyzing nothing and nothing is that serious. \n\nif you are considering watching this because there is a lot of hype around it, you should simply believe the hype. this anime has it all, flamboyant character design, tear jerking back stories, and children displaying a level of skill and art in combat that is unbelievable. my fave sub plot is when the characters start to learn more about themselves and how to act because tanjiro is simply that incredible. by existing he betters the lives of everyone he touches. power of friendship levels 100. i am an\n                  ...\n          absolute sucker for a back story i love when i can watch something and cry about other peoples fake lives so i don't have to think about my own. \nbut this anime has something for everyone's taste, very versatile. \n\na fews months ago everyone on twitter was really raving about this anime how it's better than naruto and whatever. honestly i was hurt a little. how could something be better than naruto? but it had been a while since i got into a new show so i thought i would just do it. and i HATE hype because i HATE being let down by things. also this is my first review and i don't understand why i cannot simply post that why does it have to be longer, no one is going to read this. ANYWAY i also love the art style when the characters fight. tanjiro's water breathing animated is stunning.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Trucee,"b'\n                Ugh. I am gonna say it now. This show is an overrated piece of garbage that had the potential to be not.\n\nThe story starts with Kamado family bonding then fast forward, they are killed by a demon and while they are killed the MC, Tanjiro was away. When he got back, he was shocked. Nezuko, the only survivor of the attack, was on the verge on dying then she became a demon. Giyu arrives at the scene to kill the demon, which is Nezuko, so he and Tanjiro fought a bit but in the end, because this garbage is so unoriginal, Giyu spares Nezuko for\n                  ...\n          no logical reason. After that, Tanjiro then made a resolve. REVENGE!!(Ugh. Cringe level over 9000). Then *drum roll* DEMON SLAYER!!! Wow! What a terrible premise but the fans said ""iT gEtS bEtTeR fRoM hErE"" so I pushed through.\n\nFirst, we enter a generic training arc that only has animation (the blinded A LOT of people) as its redeeming factor. There is a part here that show how poor the storytelling of the show is. We see Tanjiro training with Sabito and Makomo. Shing shing sword fight then at the end, Tanjiro and Sabito had a clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8 final sword slash. Tanjiro appeared to cut the mask of Sabito but then few shots later the stone the he cannot cut at the earlier part of the arc was cut in half. It was revealed then that Sabito and Makomo are actually dead. So my question is all this time was the rock moving and having a sword fight with Tanjiro? Such a poorly written and told fight. \n\nThen it was revealed that Nezuko was sleeping all the time and apparently sleeping makes up for hunger. Ugh. Fucking wasted potential development. Instead of giving Nezuko internal struggles of suppressing hunger and developing her from there, we get this lazy ass writing that Sakonji used an off screen hypnosis so that Nezuko won\'t eat humans. Clap, clap, clap. \n\nDevelopment: Am I a joke to you? \n\nWe could have been shown clips of Nezuko eating animals to supress her hunger and at some point make a conflict between her and Tanjiro but no the author is lazy af. This could\'ve made her an interesting and compelling character but now she is just a cardboard of an character that is mostly used for cringe ass fanservice. nEzUkO kAwAiI.\n\nThen after the training arc, we go to the final selection. There we had the first villain, the green-giant-slime guy. Typical. Tanjiro was struggling at first then at the end he wins despite not being strong enough and what is worse is that the ones with Tanjiro also undergo almost the same or exactly the same amount of training as him. Nonsensical power scaling. But there is a larger problem here. While training, Tanjiro is shown to only use normal sword attacks but during the fight suddenly he can use Water Breathing attacks that are NOT shown during the training. Sure he was also practicing his actual breathing but how does it become a Water Breathing attack was never shown. So in other words, the techniques he use (from Breathing 1-10) are like asspulls. This show uses the training arc in the worst way possible. \n\nAfter that we had a few missions of Tanjiro and Nezuko fighting demons. After all those fights, the show tries to make you feel sad for the demons but the execution (at least to me) is so bad , especially with the drums demon. I jUsT wAnT sOmEoNe tO hEaR mE!!!, that instead of making me sad, it makes me laugh and cringe at the same time. Their flashbacks are to edgy for me. Like please, give your villains variety. Have a demon that is just a villain till the end. Don\'t make them all people with sad past. It gets tiring fast.\n\nEpisode 19 is trash. Its writing is Fairy Tail writing. ""Hinokami Kagura"" is one of the biggest asspulls of the year. Water user becoming able to use Fire (without training) in the verge of being killed is one of the worst moments of 2019. After Tanjiro ""beheading"" Rui, the author tries to make his failure weigh lighter so he made a Diabolus Ex Machina for Rui. He actually beheaded himself before Tanjiro can cut him so that it won\'t look like Fairy Tail. Wow so forced. Author-san if you think you got out of the shithole, NO! It just shows how poorly written this show is. Nezuko using Demon Arts despite sleeping 80% of the time and also without training is also an offender. \n\nI almost forgot the two horrendous main characters, Inosuke and Zenitsu. Two characters with little to no development and are just there for ""comedic"" relief but they are pure annoyances. Inosuke was just too bland for me to care so....meh but Zenitsu......He is easily one of the worst characters in 2019. His character is to be annoying. Shouting here, fainting there. Funny? HELL NO!! His power is pure Deus Ex Machina and is not ashamed to hide it. \n\nWe have better revenge stories out there like Vinland Saga, which is now my gold standard for revenge stories. The author knows what he wants to do. He makes Thorfinn look pathetic because he wants to get his message across to the viewers. Revenge is stupid and a waste of time. By Episode 22 of VS, this message was sent across perfectly. That scream from Thorfinn realizing he wasted years of his life for revenge was well done. Back to Kimestu no Yaiba, revenge here is taken in such a shallow way. Revenge is just an excuse for Tanjiro\'s fight with demons to have ""weight"" but it has little to none, at least to me.\n\nLike every 10/10 anime has flaws, a 1/10 anime also has positives. Kimetsu no Yaiba is no exception. The last episode (Muzan killing the lower moons) was actually pretty solid. That\'s it. Omegalul. Bye. Peace. Signing Out. \n\nAnything not mentioned, is either a clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8 moment that didn\'t really piss me off or a forgettable moment.\n\nWait. What the fuck is the purpose of making Muzan look gay?\n              '",Demon Slayer
thatsabbydude,"b'\n                I never write reviews. But after finishing Kimetsu no Yaiba, I had to make an exception. I don\'t write for others, but just for myself. I want to remember how I felt after finishing the anime, and everything that made it great.\n\nFrom the art style, the story, the simplicity, the charming and wholesome aspect of this anime, it\'s one that just hits the heart in all the right ways. Many times things are painted in a ""us vs them"" and that applies to issues in real life and in stories, but this anime handles it a little differently, and in a way that I believe\n                  ...\n          shows emotional maturity. \nThere\'s spoilers in here, so if anyone happens to be reading this, you\'ve been warned.\n\nI wasn\'t hooked on Demon Slayer in the beginning. In fact, I\'ve heard people say how good it is and I\'ve held off on watching it for over a year. Now that the Demon Slayer movie is out, and I\'ve been watching much more anime recently, I figured I\'d finally watch it. I still think the first few episodes start off a little slow. And a little simple. Demon slayer slays demons. Cute sister is cute. Main hero believes in good wholeheartedly. People arrive to deter him. He stays strong.\nBut after a while, it starts to change. And seeing this genuine bond between brother and sister, and not this weird sexualized version of this bond like you see in No Game No Life, I began to get hooked. Seeing the wholesome aspect of it, without Tanjiro feeling like a naive child, really made me take interest. And the fight with the shadow demon, the dodgeball demon, and demon in the house, is when I really start to appreciate and really LOVE the art style. I remember seeing the characters before like Shinobu and Nezuko but I was always put off bye the style of the eyes, the ragged lines that made up the face, and what felt at the time like really strong colors that just felt off. But then I watched the show. And it all made sense.\nI was naive to put off a show on it\'s look and what it seemed to be, instead of giving it a chance, and I\'m so glad I did.\n\nThe story is simple, but fucking beautiful. I\'ve touched on the genuine bond but I also love how each demon is viewed with empathy from Tanjiro. When related back to real life, the people that do bad things are because they\'ve had bad done to them. And I think many people forget that or don\'t realize it. Tanjiro is still mad at the injustice and how the demons have killed so many humans, but at the very least he kills them with kindness. He sees the human in them, and that\'s truly what I love about this show.\n\nAt the same time, the art style during the fight scenes is incredibly. The colors, the way the fight can feel realistic (if a demon turning the room in all directions was real, ofc), to the sense of calmness in Tomiaka when he fights Rui, to Shinobu and the purple and white colors, I became in awe. It\'s easily one of the best art I\'ve seen in anime. Actually, it IS the best I\'ve seen in anime.\n\nOne thing that is slept on is the sound design. During the fight with the dodgeball monster (i\'m so sorry i keep calling her that) I really took note. The way the ball would feel as it flew towards Tanjiro, the way Tanjiro\'s sword would slice, the way Nezuko kicks the ball back and forth, was when I realize wow, not only is it all pretty to look at, but the sound is beautiful too. And not just the sound effects, but the music as well. It\'s beautiful, and perhaps I\'m mistaken in this but it feels like it has this sense of ancient chinese culture. As well as the art style, It\'s just all so beautiful and I couldn\'t get enough of it.\n\nWhen it comes to characters, I ended up loving all of them... with the exception of Zenitsu. However, even Zenitsu has his redeeming moments. The person I immediately thought of when I met Zenitsu is that this is another grapeseed from My Hero Academia. Just a pervert they added for no reason, and I was ready to drop Demon Slayer. Because I absolutely hate Minota. But I\'m glad I didn\'t. And I\'m glad I saw Zenitsu in action. He\'s like Sonic and The Flash, but in such a great, humurous, phenomonal way. The way he falls asleep, and then suddenly becomes a bad ass with great power. It made me excited to see when the next time we would be able to see his skill would be. So even Zenitsu, as annoying as he was at first and still tends to be sometimes, really grew on me. And towards the end, it seems like he\'s being taught to be more respectful and not be a pervert, so I\'m glad that he\'s likely to go through his own amazing character art.\n\nLastly, I\'ll talk about enjoyment, which I already touched upon. At first, I just wasn\'t hooked. I hated the CGI personally (even though I\'ve heard that many others find it to be great CGI) as it really took me out of the moment. A beautiful moment was ruined because it suddenly becomes ""oh...they used CGI there. Huh. It was like 2 seconds, could it not have been animated?"" but as the show goes on it uses CGI less and less and leaves it to moments in battle, which isn\'t nearly as bothersome. And as the show progressed, I really began to enjoy all aspects of it. And by the end, I just couldn\'t get enough. \nI\'m watching Demon Slayer this week and although I want to wait to watch the movie, another part of me is ITCHING to read the manga. I want more of the characters. The art style, The plot. The wholesomeness. I\'m here for the ride. And if it continues getting better and better, this is easily going to become one of my favorite anime of all time. \n\nI\'m going to give Demon Slayer a 10/10. Personally, I give 10/10 to anime that make an impact on me. FMAB made an impact on me. Steins;Gate as well. I recognize that there may be some aspects of it that bother some people, and even I have some tiny qualms with both those shows, but I don\'t think a 10/10 is about a show being perfect, as there\'s so many variables that can easily mess it up. But if as a whole, it does everything amazingly, and leaves you wanting more, and makes you want to read the manga, and leaves you wanting to rewatch the show, and leaves you thinking about the moments in the show that left you in awe....I think it deserves a 10/10.\n\nI\'m super excited to see where Demon Slayer goes, to watch the movie, to read the manga. So far it\'s a great start. And I\'m glad that I finally got on this amazing journey.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Ochita_Ou,"b""\n                The first season absolutely has a lot of potential. I probably think that this is is gonna be the future Shounen King. With Ufotable's out of the world animation and heartbreaking OST by Aniplex of America and amazing fight choreography it's bound to do so. Also it doesn't have much shounen tropes eventhough it's quite generic, for example Tanjiro doesn't always save Nezuko, it's quite the opposite also a fair number of times, also the protagonist doesnt have any grand goal. Further proof is that ep 19 was trending on twitter.The opening is amazing, sang by Lisa who is already a singer of a no.\n                  ...\n          of OP's and EDs. The difference btw this anime and black clover which another generic shounen with a lot of tropes is that it gives us something to connect to, for instance the sibling bond. And also the others of the main cast are quite well received by fans, Inosuke being a fan fav. I m really hyped for the movie and hope it lives up to the hype and that a second season comes out soon.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Mase207,"b'\n                Once every blue moon, a show comes around that pushes forth the medium. \n\nPrior to watching Demon Slayer, I felt like I was in a bit of a rut with anime - particularly shounen. I\'ve been watching anime since I was 7, and those ""magical moments"" from watching anime had become increasingly rare for me.\n\nIs Demon Slayer perfect? It depends on how we assess the word. Narratively, it\'s not pushing any boundaries by any means, following the typical ""villain of the week"" format all too common within the Shounen Jump ecosystem. The premise of Demon Slayer is indicative by its very name, a dead horse\n                  ...\n          that\'s been beaten ten feet underground. We have the typical Shounen Jump trope of ranked captains/commanders. Supporting characters include a pervert and a hothead. Yes, the typical Shounen Jump stuff. \n\nBut that\'s where apt comparisons start and end. Demon Slayer is not out to push narrative boundaries to their extremes - there\'s plenty of shows that are far more adventurous in terms of exploring unique subject material. However, Demon Slayer is a show that knows fully well what it is - an action shounen about slaying demons. It\'s not there to convince us otherwise; it embraces what we enjoy about the genre and executes it to near perfection. That\'s the keyword here - execution. Plenty of shows get the ideas right, but fumble on execution. Demon Slayer doesn\'t overcomplicate its premise, and stays true to a singular goal throughout - Tanjiro is on a mission to turn his sister back into a human. That\'s it. It\'s this singular goal in mind that makes Demon Slayer feel much more cohesive than many other Shounen Jump series, which often fall into the trap of ""How do we make this go on for as long as possible?"". A clear and unifying narrative objective from the beginning frames Tanjiro\'s decisions and actions, providing a sense of weight and significance that I seldom feel when watching other Shounen Jump titles. Tanjiro is a main character that exudes the same purehearted energy, but without the annoying tropes of naivety and stupidity. His competence and determination to achieve what he sets out to do makes him a breath of fresh air. Demon Slayer is by no means unique by premise, but does everything that it sets out to do with precision and near perfection. \n\nBy far the biggest plus for the show is its animation and art. The sheer amount of work that ufotable put behind each sequence and each frame during fight sequences is breath-taking. Camera and character movement is purposeful, guiding us through fights with a remarkable sense of fluidity and cohesion. Each fight carries weight, and rarely feel like a true ""win"" due to the delicately-crafted flashback scenes. Prior to death, we are given an intimate look at each demon\'s human past. Tanjiro\'s compassion and understanding comes through beautifully during these moments thanks to ufotable\'s exceptional composition. While each victory leads Tanjiro closer to his goal, we can see he does it out of necessity; not for enjoyment or to achieve a sense of victory. All of the elements that made Demon Slayer truly special culminated in the now-famous fight scene in episode 19. After the episode ended, I realized how grateful I was that I was witnessing something truly special. I felt emotional because of how Demon Slayer was able to make us feel like we were actually part of Tanjiro\'s journey, and I was reminded of why I fell in love with anime in the first place as a kid. \n\nThat\'s what makes Demon Slayer so remarkable to me. It\'s not unique in premise. It\'s not unique in terms of mechanics. But it\'s unique in how it brings it to life - and pushes the boundaries of how we perceive action shounen. Demon Slayer was a turning point for the industry, and raised the bar for the genre - whether you like the show or not.\n              '",Demon Slayer
itsMegster,"b'\n                ** May contain very minor spoilers **\n\nNormally I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m a bit reluctant to watch the seemingly overhyped anime series since I seem to be disappointed more times than not. However, that was not the case for Demon Slayer & I honestly regret waiting so long to give it a chance.\n\nThe main premise of the show \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d a kind hearted boy learns to fight demons in order to help turn his now demon sister back into a human \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessarily something profoundly unique, but I found the execution of the show to be incredible. The enemies Tanjiro faces are all quite interesting both in look\n                  ...\n          and the powers they possess, the animation (fight scenes in particular) are incredible to watch, and the characters are all very likable. Even some of the demons, although still evil and not necessarily redeemed by this, are made somewhat more likable due to the brief flashbacks you get to see of their past. I also especially appreciate that Nezuko is not some helpless girl that needs the big strong man to take care of her, as is the case in many series, but rather someone who can defend herself when necessary.\n\nI would also like to note that I thought it was a good call to get a brief view of the main baddie in the beginning stages of the series. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s nice to know what achieving his end goal will require Tanjiro to overcome, rather than it being some ambiguous enemy unknown to the viewer. While it is most likely assumed that Tanjiro will eventually grow to be a worthy opponent to Kibutsuji, I am definitely looking forward to see how he gets there. The ending especially has me hyped for how Tanjiro & company will face the obstacles Kibutsuji will inevitably put in their way.\n\nMy only nitpicks with the show are that the more humorous scenes are sometimes a bit hit or miss & that some of the characters (ie. Inosuke and Zenitsu) were introduced in a way that made them seem rather obnoxious. Thankfully, after the episode that introduced them, I found them to be much more enjoyable additions to this show.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Lunachuu,"b'\n                I may be a bit biased in terms of all the ratings, but I can rationalize every single one, so really, how biased can I be...\n\n*May contain minor spoilers.\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba / Demon Slayer is a masterpiece, plain and simple. And frankly, I\'m tired of plenty of more old-school anime enjoyers pretending it\'s not. \n\nThe story itself is fantastic. It\'s simple and straightforward, and yet it\'s got plenty of depth that makes it so interesting and keeps me, as well as many, many others, coming back for more. The concept of family being important being driven home is so dear to my heart, and it\n                  ...\n          means a lot to me to see it handled in such a fantastic way. They don\'t just say ""blood family is important, don\'t abandon them"", but they explore the depth of what ""family is important"" can mean.\n\nNezuko is his blood family. Friends Tanjiro meets along the way become family. But more than that, Demon Slayer also goes in on how even though you may be family with someone (ignoring the fact that the Spider Family isn\'t real family, the point the story makes is still relevant) it doesn\'t mean you can treat them how you please. Family is important, but what the story really emphasizes is that healthy, loving family is important. And that those you love dearly are the true family.\n\nArt and animation? What else would I expect from Ufotable? Utter brilliance. It\'s no MAPPA adaptation, but the animation and style still has a charm that fits the manga\'s style to a T. It\'s not the kind of anime that needs a MAPPA level animation quality, in my eyes. The style Ufotable has lavished unto this series suits it perfectly.\n\nThe characters are all pretty great, as well. Honestly, I would chock it down a point for some of the characters introduced (not to start an argument, but Zenitsu could use some work) but Tanjiro in particular strikes me as an especially well-written character. He\'s kind, but that\'s not the only thing about him. His depth is incredible. He\'s kind, yes, and that\'s so important, but he\'s also not hesitant to cut down those who go against his laws--the strong protect the weak, and the weak in turn become strong to protect those weaker than them. He empathizes with demons, but this does not cloud his judgement nor waver the strikes of his blade.\n\nIt\'s got me hooked to see more. It\'s the most enjoyable series I\'ve had the pleasure of watching/reading. I\'d deeply, deeply recommend Demon Slayer to ANY anime watcher, new or old. You won\'t regret it.\n              '",Demon Slayer

After all, taste is subjective and there are no right or wrong opinions. But there is a certain word that gets constantly thrown around when discussing this anime that honestly makes my blood boil. The word is \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93overrated.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd What usually accompanies is a whole slew of erroneous criticisms of Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s writing based entirely on misunderstanding. The usual sentiment is \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93the visuals are good but the writing is mediocre,\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd said to seem intelligent while confidently missing the point of the\n                  ...\n          writing.\n\nNow don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t get me wrong, Demon Slayer is not perfect, far from it. There are plenty of valid criticisms of how it was composed but \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93overrated\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd is so often used to sidestep them and avoid analysing through any form of artistic lense. So in this review I will be explaining in no uncertain terms the heart of Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s writing and hopefully convincing some less astute viewers why Demon Slayer deserves the praise that it has received. I will do my best to avoid spoilers but there may be some slip ups.\n\nDemon Slayer has three core themes: the tragedy of losing one\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s humanity, the coexistence of anger and compassion, and the strength that arises from love.\n\nDespite the name \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Demon Slayer,\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd the story goes to great lengths to ensure that the demons in the show are humanised. Almost every significant demon that we meet is given a backstory and a flashback to their time as a human. The demons\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 attributes are often related to what they cared about back when they were human which is usually expressed through their respective Blood Demon Arts. The show puts on full display how the things we cherish as humans can become twisted and sinister should we lose our humanity and moral compass. It provides a tragic juxtaposition of the bloodthirsty monster overcome by instinct and the passionate people they once were. Demon Slayer is trying to get the viewer to empathize with the terror of losing yourself and your identity to the point where no one, not even yourself, can forgive what you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve done. This empathy expressed through the protagonist Tanjiro Kamado reflects the next theme.\n\nOne of my favorite lines from the show which I believe encapsulates this theme very well is when Tanjiro says, \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93I understand you but I cannot forgive you.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd What is being communicated is that these demons have killed many people and as should die for it, but that should not bring us to blind hatred and lack compassion for them. After all, they too were once human who were transformed into demons against their will. We often feel as though compassion and anger are mutually exclusive sentiments, but Demon Slayer speaks to the importance of having resolve in compassion and empathy in anger. This theme is expressed through many characters, most starkly through Shinobu Kocho, who puts into more mature words the sentiments of our protagonist. It is a consistent undercurrent in the show that gives it its more sympathetic tone.\n\nThe last and most easily observed is the strength that arises from love. On the surface, this may seem like the stereotypical \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93protecting the people you care about\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd that we see time and again in Shounen shows, but Demon Slayer brings a fresh perspective on this idea. It is observed most clearly in the character dynamic between the protagonist Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko. Unlike what some viewers may expect, Nezuko is not relegated to the role of damsel in distress as Tanjiro beats the bad guys for her. Rather, both Nezuko and Tanjiro are both highly competent and they give each other the resolve to fight. Demon Slayer shows that love, and the strength that it gives, goes both ways.\n\nStory - 9\n\nAs I have discussed, the macro-level writing for Demon Slayer is handled with a great deal of skill and nuance. On the other hand, the micro-level writing also shines through with the excellent work of director Sotozaki. The show does an excellent job of building tension leading up to climaxes and releasing tension afterward without diminishing its importance. In all the conflicts it is felt that the characters are truly in danger and trying their hardest. An excellent example of this would be when Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s sword was broken by the spider\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s thread. It put into perspective just how incredibly outmatched he was. The pacing is excellent and makes it so that each episode leads seamlessly into the next, creating one long, cohesive story. One issue I have with the writing is that it occasionally chooses the wrong things to do in-depth explanations. There were key plot points that I was not able to pick up until rewatching that I believe could have been expressed better. I can understand why some viewers call these events Deus Ex Machina if they are unable to notice the subtle foreshadowing.\n\nArt - 10\n\nI think this should be pretty self-explanatory. Ufotable clearly cut no corners in the visual production of this show. I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t think I need to tell anyone that the fight scenes are beautifully animated with phenomenal attention to detail. Even beyond that, the art is consistently clean and crisp which really helps the unique style that the artists were going for. The visual metaphors that accompany the sword-work are extremely creative and add serious excitement to even relatively grounded abilities.\n\nSound - 10\n\nThe sound design for Demon Slayer is absolutely brilliant. As I mentioned in my \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93story\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd section, the writers are able to build tension to great effect at various points in the show. The soundtrack plays a big part in this. Each track perfectly accompanies the moment and its tone, whether it be sentimental or grandiose. There are certain moments that would be otherwise difficult to swallow but the sound direction makes completely natural. By far the best example would be the first time we see Zenitsu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hidden abilities. It is a brilliant subversion of expectations made all the more impactful by the introduction of his theme that would go on to appear more in the series.\n\nCharacters - 9\n\nThe characters are nothing short of iconic. In just a year after release, many Demon Slayer characters are ubiquitously recognized in pop culture. This is due in no small part to the concise characterization that each of them receive. The show ensures that the viewer is able to get the main ideas about a character very soon after their introduction, and further elaborate beyond that. This allows for expedient and efficient character building that still feels organic in the moment. What makes this all the more impressive is that the show always leaves unanswered questions and room to expand upon. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s why so many of the characters have an air of mystery and awe. It is unfortunate that due to its relatively short run time for a Shounen, Demon Slayer has yet to demonstrate the full potential of its strong cast. If character writing of this caliber continues, this section will be an easy 10.\n\nEnjoyment - 10\n\nThere is good reason for Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s mainstream success. Even if you watch it at its most surface level, you will still be thoroughly entertained. Most people can pick up Demon Slayer and get great value out of it without having to devote serious time toward analysis. However as I have discussed, there is much to be appreciated if one does put in serious analysis. This, I believe, is the root of the problem with many Demon Slayer viewers. They watch the series, see its surface level qualities, and assume that those are all that the series has to offer. I implore all viewers to think critically about this anime and I guarantee that you will get more out of it.\n\nOverall - 9\n              '",Demon Slayer
Artfishbot,"b""\n                Is this the best anime ever? No, it isn't.  Is it really better than Death Parade? Probably not, but I don't care.  The beautiful music, the fluid animation, the great character design, and talented voice work all come together to make an amazing experience.  The story is the weakest part but it's not a bad one.  Rather than having Tanjirou want to be the best and the strongest like every other shounen protagonist, Demon Slayer has his motivations based on the unbreakable bond between him and his sister.  All he wants to do is to save his sister.  He\n                  ...\n          constantly  sympathizes with many demons even though he can't forgive them.  Showing his empathy rather than showing in one scene he saving a jerk and everyone is surprised, or his saying out loud that he will never ever give up on his friends. \n Which is quite refreshing.  The fight scenes are some of the best in anime yet.  The best one (you know the one) is what this anime is really about.  A beautiful anime contrasted with its elegant storytelling.  Ufotable did a fantastic job adapting the manga by making the art better than the manga and the music is so good perfectly matching the tone of each fight and knowing when to focus on the fight and then the music and then both at the same time.

Ryunushi,"b'\n                Katanas have been my weapon of choice since before I started watching anime, and Kimetsu no Yaiba just made that decision a lot stronger. Feeling as if the story would start by going easy on me, I started watching the anime after many months of its final chapter\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4s official release. The reason? I\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4am not particularly attracted to anime that becomes famous quickly, but after months of seeing that this one was on the top most watched animes for a long time, curiosity knocked at the doors of my brain. So, as I said earlier, I thought the story development would go easy on me at\n                  ...\n          the start, leading me in a rising direction towards an epic climax of a final fight, so naive was I this time.\n\nInstead of that typical structure, the story gave me goosebumps from the very beggining, strangely feeling like danger was at my doorstep as the first episode was only beggining, and I questioned myself: Why? It looks so peaceful, so happy, like sunrise in the morning, but it was only the start of an epic voyage with the strong and inspiring will of the protagonist, the proximity of death at each footstep, having your chest at the limit between absolute suspense, and that ecstasy attained only when the final blow has been dealt. This journey is taken along with our protagonist, struggling to be stronger every time, just to end realizing a heavy truth: ""we can never be strong enough, both in our physique and in our willpower"".\n              '",Demon Slayer
IcarusxIcarus,"b'\n                (From my Instagram page)\nThe Appeal of Demon Slayer:\nPart 1:\nWhat is the appeal of the Demon Slayer franchise? My first response to this question would be the premise. As a fan of both Seraph of the End and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, I wasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t surprised to find myself hooked by the first chapter of the Demon Slayer manga. I find the the premise of these three stories to be very appealing, I love the idea of having a character not only lose their entire family, but to then have a member of their family survive, only to be turned into the very creature responsible for\n                  ...\n          the massacre (Kabaneri diverges slightly, having the protagonist be the one turn into the creature). What I find so appealing about this premise is that it is the perfect plot device. Having the protagonist lose their entire family at the start of a story effectively leaves them with nothing left, they must rebuild their lives. It allows for the protagonist to simply move forward, since they no longer have anything to go back to. They are also left resenting the creatures who ruined their lives, the addition of having a surviving family member turn into one of these creatures ensures that the main character\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s rage will never subside. Demon Slayer follows this formula well which may been seen as a negative by others, but if you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re a fan of either of the other series I mentioned (or AOT) then you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re sure to enjoy Demon Slayer. Demon Slayer also slightly diverges from the protagonist resenting the creatures (demons in Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s case) as Tanjiro is actually able to empathise with the demons, which is seen as a weakness by other characters, but I find it to add a lot of nuance to his character. The bloodthirsty, revenge driven main character archetype has started to lose its touch as of late, therefor, the mangaka behind Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s decision to change things up is a very welcome one. \nIn summary, Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s premise isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t incredible original, but as someone who generally likes it in other stories, I find it to be very appealing and one of Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s biggest strengths. I have only touched on the premise, but there is still so much that is great about Demon Slayer, expect more posts coming soon.\n\nPart 2:\nI have already gone into a great deal of depth explaining what I think the appeal of Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s premise is, so in this post I will be touching on what else is so great about Demon Slayer. I won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t go into as much detail since I think that the premise is the most crucial part, but I shall endeavour to touch on everything that I like.\n\nThe character designs in Demon Slayer are, in a word, fantastic. They are very striking and leave a strong impression on you, it is a great feat for a character design to so perfectly represent the personality of a character, but Demon Slayer is able to pull this feat off consistently. \nThe characters in general are also strong, I would say that Tanjiro could be a better protagonist, however, he does his job well and enables the mangaka to introduce more interesting characters as the story goes on. \nWhen it comes to the anime adaptation, only three episodes may be out, however, all have had brilliant visuals. The use of CGI is actually beneficial to the anime, which is very rare for a modern anime. The CGI allows for lots of great camera movement, mainly the fantastic tracking shots of Tanjiro that have been shown thus far. I also love the effects, such as the fog and snow, they create an environment that feels real. Despite being animated, the world that the characters inhabit actually feels lived in and authentic. I really cannot stress how much this does for an anime. \nThe soundtrack is also great, the song that played when Tanjiro was preparing to leave for the town in the first episode was one of the best soundtracks I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve heard in anime. It really gave off the feeling that despite the fact that Tanjiro was only leaving to go to town, a mundane task, he was really setting out on a grand adventure, which is what happened.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Damuzen,"b'\n                Hi all my friends, we find ourselves for a new review and - / WALL /\n\nI want to remind you that I write very rarely reviews, so necessarily my style and my development will not be of an irreproachable quality, do not expect some Edgar Allan Poe-esque novel\n\nWhen I heard about Kimetsu no Yaiba for the first time, I was rather intrigued, and happy, because I was still watching Dororo and I realy liked that atmosphere of ancient Japan with samurai and demons\n\nAs for many seasonal anime, I inquired to the bare minimum, if at all, so as not to spoil me anything. Did I\n                  ...\n          regret it? No.\n\nBut enough of procrastination, let\'s go directly to the review.\n\nStory : 8/10\nIf we look more closely, the story of Kimetsu no Yaiba is not really special, or unique. It is rather banal. But good, refreshing and very pleasant to follow.\nIf it does not shine by its complexity, its denouements or its depth, it remains very appreciable. I never found myself pointing at scripting mistakes, inconsistencies or even pacing issues. Well, I must say that I am very good public.\nI let myself be carried away by the story of Kimetsu no Yaiba, and it was a particularly pleasant trip.\n\nArt : 10/10\nOne of the big highlights of this anime.\nThere is so much to say ...\nFirst, the setting is often very pretty, the anime is mostly in rural areas which allows to show beautiful landscapes, often detailed and wild.\nThe more urban atmosphere is very surprising, because we are talking here of Japan from the beginning of the 20th century, a Japan that enters modernity but still deeply rooted in its traditions and its rurality. The contrast between the countryside and the city is bluffing.\nThe animation during the fights is impeccable, nothing to say on it. Of course, we immediately think of episode 19, but each fight of this anime was beautifully animated. The visual of the breath attacks is particularly beautiful.\nFinally, of course, let\'s talk about the CGI.\nAs I already said in another review, I am VERY sensitive to the CGI in animes, and in almost all cases, I find it ugly and it lowers my enjoyment. Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the few animes where this is not the case.\nThe CGI is MAGNIFICENT. Not just ""passable"" or ""ok"", it\'s really beautiful. In addition, it gives rise to spectacular scenes, such as the fight against arrow and balloon demons, or more recently in the Inception-like maze of Muzan.\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nThe other strong point of this anime. First of all, I love the opening, it\'s one of my favorites all anime included. The ending is also very beautiful, these are points that are really important for me in an anime.\nBut what about the OST ? This is one of the best I have ever heard ! The association of Western orchestral music with traditional Japanese music gave me eargasms. The music is brilliantly used throughout the anime, and contribute enormously to the creation of all this special atmosphere that continuously emanates from KnY.\n\nCharacters: 9/10\nThat we agree: KnY characters do not have a complexity out of the ordinary, as is the case for some anime. Yet, I appreciate them (all) enormously.\nDemons often have an interesting backstory that helps the viewer to sympathize with them, without going into melodramatic Naruto-like backstories.\nThe pillars also have an interesting personality and story. For now, we have only been able to see Shinobu\'s, but having read the manga and without spoil, I can simply say that the other pillars are mostly extremely nice and their stories well built too.\nThe same goes for other secondary characters, who show admirable feelings, and who never fall into the generic and clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 behaviors.\nTanjiro, the protagonist, is incredibly pleasant. We have an intelligent MC, who is reasonable in his judgment and decisions, and who ... is just incredibly human. It is very rare to see a shonen protagonist who shows compassion, a virtue that is essential for a human being. This compassion (which is not naivety, beware of that) makes Tanjiro very pleasant and attracts all the sympathy from the viewer.\nIn contrary to what some people feel, I really appreciate the character of Zenitsu. Yes, he screams a lot, yes, he is noisy. I totally understand that it can annoy a lot of people. But ... that\'s not my case! I appreciate his role as a comic relief.\nThe same goes for Inosuke, who, in addition, has an interesting development as he spends time with Tanjiro and Zenitsu.\n\nReject it or not, but Inosuke is the best waifu.\n\nAnd, of course, let\'s finish with the best: Nezuko. I have rarely seen such a lovely and at the same time as useful character. It would have been easy to create a cute but plug-and-play character, who just does some cute stuff. But this is not the case of Nezuko, who in addition to being cute, will go and beats up the mouths of the bad guys.\nShe is already the source of many memes on the Internet, and she deserves it totally. Praise Nezuko.\nI also want to add that I love the relationship she has with her big brother. It\'s Japan, so it would have been hardly surprising to have hints sometimes misplaced about the brother-sister relationship. But it is not the case here. It is truly a pure and touching fraternal relationship as we see little.\n\nOverall appreciation: 10/10\nKimetsu no Yaiba quickly became one of my favorite anime. Oh yes, nothing more.\nI did not get bored for a second, and I was frustrated at the end of each episode because there was nothing next. Waiting a week each time was frustrating, and every episode delighted me. This anime really touched me, and I can not wait to see the next arc of the Ghost Train ! (although I have already read the manga!)\n\n\nI also want to add my personal opinion on a subject: that of the fandom.\nI find it strange that when you belong to a certain community, it necessarily forces you to disagree with other communities.\nEveryone\'s opinion is purely personal and relatively subjective.\nIf someone tells me he does not like KnY, I\'ll be surprised, I\'ll try to find out why, but I will not force them to like this anime because I love it.\nIf someone does not agree with you, do not attack them by saying they are wrong. Do not denigrate them because they does not have the same tastes as you.\nThe same goes for rivalries and ""wars"" between communities: loving an anime does not prevent you from loving another, a ""rival"" anime.\nIf I like an anime, it\'s because of what it makes me feel. The emotions I feel watching it, its characters, its story, its music. But not what people or communities could dictate to me.\nOf course, listening to advice and opinions is always something positive, but it\'s up to me and only me to judge what I should like or not.\n\n\n\n[French version/Version fran\xc3\x83\xc2\xa7aise]\n\n\nSalut \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 tous, les amis, on se retrouve pour une nouvelle review et -/MUR/\n\nJe tiens \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 rappeler que je n\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cris que tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s rarement de reviews, donc forc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ment mon style et mon d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9veloppement ne seront pas d\'une qualit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 irr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9prochable, ne vous attendez pas \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 du Edgar Allan Poe\n\nQuand j\'ai entendu parler de Kimetsu no Yaiba la premi\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8re fois, j\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9tais plut\xc3\x83\xc2\xb4t intrigu\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9, et content, car j\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9tais encore en plein visionnage de Dororo et cette atmosph\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8re de Japon ancien et de d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9mons me plaisait \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9norm\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ment\n\nComme pour beaucoup d\'animes saisonniers, je me suis renseign\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 au strict minimum, voire pas du tout, afin de ne rien me g\xc3\x83\xc2\xa2cher. Est-ce que je l\'ai regrett\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 ? Aucunement.\n\nMais tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8ve de tergiversations, passons directement \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 la review.\n\nHistoire : 8/10\nSi l\'on y regarde de plus pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s, l\'histoire de Kimetsu no Yaiba n\'a rien de vraiment sp\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cial, ou unique. Elle est plut\xc3\x83\xc2\xb4t banale. Mais bonne, rafra\xc3\x83\xc2\xaechissante et tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s agr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9able \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 suivre.\nSi elle ne brille pas par sa complexit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9, ses d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9nouements ou sa profondeur, elle reste tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s appr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ciable.  Je ne me suis jamais retrouv\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 pointer du doigt des erreurs sc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9naristiques, des incoh\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rences ou m\xc3\x83\xc2\xaame des probl\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8mes de rythme. Bon, il faut dire que je suis tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s bon public. \nJe me suis laiss\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 porter par l\'histoire de Kimetsu no Yaiba, et ce fut un voyage particuli\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8rement plaisant.\n\nArt : 10/10\nL\'un des gros points forts de cet anime. \nIl y a tellement \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 dire...\nTout d\'abord, les d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cors sont souvent tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s jolis, l\'anime se passe en majeure partie en milieu rural ce qui permet de montrer de beaux paysages, souvent d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9taill\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s et sauvages. \nL\'ambiance plus urbaine est tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s surprenante, car on parle ici du Japon du d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9but du XXe si\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8cle, un Japon qui entre dans la modernit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 mais encore profond\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ment ancr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 dans ses traditions et sa ruralit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9. Le contraste entre la campagne et la ville est bluffant.\nL\'animation lors des combats est impeccable, rien \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 dire l\xc3\x83\xc2\xa0-dessus. Bien \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9videmment, on pense tout de suite \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 l\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9pisode 19, mais chaque combat de cet anime a \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9t\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 magnifiquement anim\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9. Le visuel des attaques de souffle est particuli\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8rement beau. \nEnfin, bien s\xc3\x83\xc2\xbbr, parlons du CGI. \nComme je l\'ai d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9j\xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 peut \xc3\x83\xc2\xaatre dit dans une autre review, je suis TRES sensible au CGI dans les animes, et dans presque tous les cas, je le trouve moche et il nuit \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 mon appr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ciation. Kimetsu no Yaiba est l\'un des rares animes o\xc3\x83\xc2\xb9 ce n\'est pas le cas.\nLe CGI est MAGNIFIQUE. Pas juste ""passable"" ou ""correct"", c\'est vraiment beau. En plus, cela donne naissance \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 des sc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8nes spectaculaires, comme le combat contre les d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9mons aux fl\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8ches et aux ballons, ou plus r\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cemment dans le d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9dale de Muzan fa\xc3\x83\xc2\xa7on Inception. \n\nSoundtrack : 10/10\nL\'autre point fort de cet anime. Tout d\'abord, j\'adore l\'opening, c\'est l\'un de mes pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9f\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9r\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s tous animes confondus. L\'ending lui aussi est tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s beau d\'ailleurs, ce sont des points qui jouent beaucoup dans un anime.\nMais que dire de l\'OST ? C\'est l\'une des meilleures que je n\'ai jamais entendues ! L\'association de musique orchestrale occidentale \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 de la musique traditionnelle japonaise est \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 la limite orgasmique pour les oreilles. Les musiques sont brillamment utilis\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9es au fil de l\'anime, et participent \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9norm\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ment \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 la cr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ation de toute cette ambiance si particuli\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8re qui \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9mane continuellement de KnY. \n\nPersonnages : 9/10\nQue l\'on se mette d\'accord : les personnages de KnY n\'ont pas une complexit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 hors du commun, comme c\'est le cas pour certains animes. Pourtant, je les appr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cie (tous) \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9norm\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ment. \nLes d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9mons ont souvent une backstory int\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ressant et qui aide \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 compatir avec eux, sans pour autant partir dans du m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9lodramatique \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 la Naruto. \nLes piliers ont eux aussi une personnalit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 et une histoire int\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ressantes. Pour l\'instant, on a seulement pu voir le parcours de Shinobu, mais ayant lu le manga et sans spoil, je peux simplement dire que les autres piliers sont pour la plupart extr\xc3\x83\xc2\xaamement sympathiques et leurs histoires bien construites, elles aussi.\nIl en va de m\xc3\x83\xc2\xaame pour les autres personnages, parfois un peu plus secondaires, qui font preuve de sentiments admirables, et qui ne tombent jamais dans les comportements g\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9riques et clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s.\nTanjiro, le protagoniste, est incroyablement agr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9able. On a un MC qui r\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9fl\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9chit, est raisonnable dans son jugement et ses d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cisions, et qui...est juste incroyablement humain. Il est tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s rare de voir un protagoniste de shonen faire preuve de compassion, une vertu pourtant primordiale pour un \xc3\x83\xc2\xaatre humain. Cette compassion (qui n\'est pas de la na\xc3\x83\xc2\xafvet\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9, attention) rend Tanjiro tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s agr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9able et attire toute la sympathie du spectateur.\nContrairement \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 ce que certains ressentent, j\'appr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cie beaucoup le personnage de Zenitsu. Oui, il crie beaucoup, oui, il est bruyant. Je comprends totalement qu\'il puisse agacer bon nombre de personnes. Mais...ce n\'est pas mon cas ! J\'appr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9cie son r\xc3\x83\xc2\xb4le de comic relief.\nIl en va de m\xc3\x83\xc2\xaame pour Inosuke, qui en plus, a un d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9veloppement int\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ressant au fur et \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 mesure qu\'il passe du temps avec Tanjiro et Zenitsu.\n\nR\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9futez-le ou non, mais Inosuke est la meilleure waifu. \n\nEt, bien s\xc3\x83\xc2\xbbr, finissons avec le meilleur : Nezuko. J\'ai rarement vu un personnage aussi adorable et en m\xc3\x83\xc2\xaame temps aussi utile. Il aurait \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9t\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 facile de cr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9er un personnage mignon mais bouche-trou, qui se contente de faire des trucs mignons. Mais ce n\'est pas le cas de Nezuko, qui en plus d\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xaatre mignonne, va aller casser les bouches des m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9chants. \nElle est d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9j\xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 la source de nombreux memes sur Internet, et elle le m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rite totalement. Praise Nezuko.\nJe tiens aussi \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 rajouter que j\'adore la relation qu\'elle entretient avec son grand fr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8re. Japon oblige, il aurait \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9t\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 peine surprenant d\'avoir des allusions parfois d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9plac\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9es sur les relations entre fr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8re et soeur. Mais ce n\'est pas le cas ici. C\'est vraiment une pure et touchante relation fraternelle comme on en voit peu.\n\nAppr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ciation g\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9rale : 10/10\nKimetsu no Yaiba s\'est tr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8s vite plac\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 parmi mes animes favoris. Et oui, rien que \xc3\x83\xc2\xa7a.\nJe ne me suis pas ennuy\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 une seule seconde, et j\'ai \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9t\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 frustr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 chaque fin d\'\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9pisode car il n\'y avait plus rien ensuite. Attendre une semaine \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 chaque fois \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9tait frustrant, et chaque \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9pisode me ravissait. Cet anime m\'a vraiment touch\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9, et j\'ai h\xc3\x83\xc2\xa2te de voir le prochain arc du Train de l\'Infini ! (m\xc3\x83\xc2\xaame si j\'ai d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9j\xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 lu le manga !)\n\n\nJe tiens aussi \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 placer mon avis personnel sur un sujet : celui du fandom. \nJe trouve \xc3\x83\xc2\xa7a \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9trange que, lorsque l\'on appartient \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 une certaine communaut\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9, cela nous oblige forc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9ment \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x83\xc2\xaatre en d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9saccord avec d\'autres communaut\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s.\nL\'avis d\'un chacun est purement personnel et relativement subjectif. \nSi quelqu\'un me dit qu\'il n\'aime pas KnY, je vais \xc3\x83\xc2\xaatre surpris, je chercherai \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 savoir pourquoi, mais je ne le forcerai pas \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 aimer cet anime, sous pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9texte que je l\'aime moi. \nSi quelqu\'un n\'est pas d\'accord avec vous, n\'allez pas l\'agresser en disant qu\'il a tort. Ne le d\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9nigrez pas parce qu\'il n\'a pas les m\xc3\x83\xc2\xaames go\xc3\x83\xc2\xbbts que vous. \nIl en va de m\xc3\x83\xc2\xaame pour les rivalit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s et les ""guerres"" entre communaut\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s : aimer un anime ne vous emp\xc3\x83\xc2\xaache pas d\'en aimer un autre, un ""rival"".\nSi j\'aime un anime, c\'est pour ce qu\'il r\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9veille en moi. Les \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9motions que je ressens en le regardant, ses personnages, son histoire, sa musique. Mais pas ce que pourraient me dicter des personnes ou des communaut\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s. \nBien s\xc3\x83\xc2\xbbr, \xc3\x83\xc2\xa9couter des conseils et des avis est toujours quelque chose de positif, mais c\'est \xc3\x83\xc2\xa0 moi seul de juger ce que j\'aime ou non.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Akira_Habane,"b""\n                Hippity hippity Demon Slayer lacks titties, and I'm fine with that. \n\nIt's been ages since the day Kimetsu no Yaiba exploded, and people worldwide got blown away by what this anime can offer. After finally having the time to catch up to observe what made its potential bloom, I can say this anime deserves the recognition it deserves.\n\nPlot-wise, it's nothing revolutionary nor narrates complex writing of any sort, but rather, it simply tells the story of our protagonist, Tanjiro, in his typical Shonen adventure to seek answers and revenge for his family that got annihilated by some Demon ('tis not a spoiler though, it's literally\n                  ...\n          the summary so don't fret ). It follows the same formula for almost all anime belonging to the shonen genre, but like many good shonen anime's out there, they executed it well, seriously. There's a starting point, a wise old man, grinding arc, existential crisis arc, death of friends arc, and of course, the unbeatable plot armor that continues to shield our beloved shonen protagonists from the misery they ought to face in their journey. And while it sticks to that cliche formula, they've carried it out well that I've no grudge against them, because it's that good.\n\nI've got nothing to say for the soundtracks except it made my ears cum to the banger OP that I guess to anyone reading this, probably heard. But it's not only the opening that deserves the grace it receives, but I'd like to point out the fitting scores that captures the overall tone of the scene, thus brought me for a much more immersive experience. Though I guess what made my view on the soundtracks much more on the positive side is that the scores DURING the fight scenes are truly incredible, I unconsciously left my jaw-dropping for a moment there. \n\nThe animators however, unlike many generic anime's out there, simply didn't hold their crotches and instead focused on drawing every little detail and movement while animating each frame. I caught up late on this anime but I can still say the visuals are magnificent enough to make its popularity rise above the heavens and attract new preys to this bizarre anime community. Knowing the studio behind this is Ufotable, you can clear any anxieties regarding lazy animation of any sort, as they're known to throw away budget like there's no tomorrow. \n\nBut I guess what I truly liked about Demon Slayer is that its approach to villains, is new to my perspective. Instead of just continuing the episode after defeating a villain to proceed to the next arc, Demon Slayer merely reveals each demon's background, some having unique and impactful history, and some are mediocre enough for me to forget, but when the meaningful lore shows, goddamn it hits right in the feels. And I like it; I like how the villains, even with cruel desires, have a past of their own to explain their present actions. This approach, for me personally, is what made Demon Slayer a good anime for me, even with all the flaws and generic bullshit the author proceeded to insert. I usually sympathize with the villains I see as long as they have a meaningful and relevant background to justify their actions, and Demon Slayer somehow captured my sympathy with their villains.\n\nFanservice is uhmmm...few or close to none. The only fanservice you get is from our protagonist's little sister, and that's terribly adorable alright. I did find myself smirking from the noises (no lewd intention ( \xc3\x8d\xc2\xa1\xc3\x82\xc2\xb0 \xc3\x8d\xc5\x93\xc3\x8a\xe2\x80\x93 \xc3\x8d\xc2\xa1\xc3\x82\xc2\xb0) ) the little sister makes, but hey, she's really cute ya know. \n\nSo anyways, I see that many diehard anime fans shit on this anime for being overrated and lacking in aspects many underappreciated anime's have, and I don't give the slightest damn about that and you shouldn't too. It's really not an anime with deep storytelling nor life-changing wisdom to teach you, but if you're a casual anime watcher like me or even a newbie in the field of anime, then feel free to give this a try and have your virginity taken by Demon Slayer as you begin your journey to explore many more anime's out there in the future.\n              """,Demon Slayer
toasterinmytub,"b""\n                First let me say, Kimetsu no Yaiba has great animation. I honestly don't mind the CG use too much but besides that I thought it was very unique and something I haven't seen before. The fight scenes are enjoyable and I like to see the solutions that Tanjiro comes up with to defeat his enemies. The music and sound design are also pretty good, however, I'm not a huge fan of the music.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about it for the good parts of this show. The storyline is super generic, guy wants revenge and to save his sister, so he joins a group of Demon Slayers to\n                  ...\n          fight evil. Wow. The demon concept is interesting, but I think sometimes it can be awkward to fit in decapitations of human eating demons with scenes of wacky characters, right after a death.\n\nThat's probably my least favorite thing about this show actually. The characters just don't fit, at least in my opinion. Tanjiro the protagonist seems very cookie cutter and the yellow haired kid is annoying to say the least. You would think a show with a generic plot would make up for it with good characters that don't get on your nerves too much, but watching their conversations and interactions was very boring and I could pretty much tell exactly what each character was going to say before they said it.\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba is very.... okay. I'll continue to skip the boring parts and try to see what direction the anime goes but after all, this could of had so much potential.  6/10\n              """,Demon Slayer
ladymoonbeam,"b'\n                This is my first review, so it may not be the best! Thank you for looking at it, though!\n\nI love Demon Slayer. I am one of those freaks who has a Top 10 Anime list, and Demon Slayer falls squarely at #7. Demon Slayer pulled me in, enchanted me, enthralled me, made me emotional, and completely captured my heart.\n\nThe thing is, I can\'t figure out how it did it.\n\nIn writing this review, I am asking myself, ""What makes this anime so special?"" ""How did it rise above and dethrone Rising of the Shield Hero as #7 in your list?"" ""Why do you think everyone under\n                  ...\n          the sun should give this anime a chance?"" I sincerely don\'t know the answers to these questions, but I\'m going to take a crack at it.\n\nDemon Slayer is a quintessential shounen anime. Right down to its core, it is shounen. Male protagonist with troubled past? Check. Said protagonist starts off weak but gets the hang of it with the help of antagonistic\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dbut generally good-natured\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9drivals? Check. Band of merry friends who cause as much trouble as they do solve? Check. Mysterious, absent father figure? Check. Characters who have specific fighting styles that are generally based around an element and have attack names that fit that element? Check. Long strings of minor villians that serve to solidify\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dbut sometimes raise questions about\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dthe protagonist\'s beliefs? Check. ...Imperialistic symbols? ...Check... God, I\'m honestly wracking my brain, trying to think of more shounen tropes. The point is that this anime is a shounen, and not a super original one.\n\nMaybe the familiarity of this show is what made me love it? Despite Demon Slayer\'s lack of originality, it executes (heh) its genre with finesse. This anime is nothing that I haven\'t seen before, but it all feels so fresh and new. I do have to say, though\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dMeiji-Era Japan makes for a wonderful backdrop, especially when the protagonist enters a big city for the first time. The stark contrast between rural and urban is something you experience at the same time as the other characters, and it makes you feel very out-of-place.\n\nI also have to praise the characters. It feels like every single character is fleshed out in some way\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9deven the minor villians. Everyone gets a story, and everyone\'s story has a resolution. In addition, I love that the protagonist\'s kindness is never a weakness. The protagonist treats everyone around him with respect, even if he\'s fighting against them. He realizes that even demons have a past, and he\'s attentive to what may be important to them. My favourite example of this is when he avoids stepping on paper that\'s scattered on the floor, because it may be part of his adversary\'s most precious memories. He sees good in everyone, but he never allows that to be a crutch. He knows what his job is, and he always gets that job done without resorting to cruelty.\n\nWas it really just the characters that made me fall in love with Demon Slayer? I honestly don\'t know. I feel like there is so much to love about this anime, but I not sure how to put it into words. It\'s really special.\n\nWith that, I will end this review by thanking you for taking the time to read it. I really appreciate it!\n              '",Demon Slayer
johnthegreenseer,"b""\n                Gotta say, after completing this anime, you've gotta be questionably mad to drop this show. This anime definitely goes onto my list of one of my top anime ever. While I won't spoil the plot of this anime in this review, I will assume that you have at least read a blurb for this anime. If you are completely blind to this series and don't even want to know the premise, I'll caution you to avoid this review. Kimetsu no Yaiba is a shounen anime that explores a world set in Taisho era Japan festering with demons that antagonize humanity and the eponymous demon slayers\n                  ...\n          who deal with them. Our protagonist is Tanjiro Kamido, a young boy who finds himself introduced to the demon slaying life after being faced with tragedy. Accompanying him is his younger sister, Nezuko Kamido, who is gravely affected by the tragedy when she is transformed into a demon. Following this, the two begin a journey in order to find a cure to reverse Nezuko's transformation. Now, I know the premise is a bit mediocre but this anime makes up for it with its interesting characters and captivating animation.\n\n(STORY & CHARACTERS) While the background for the siblings isn't quite unique, their personalities are compelling enough to keep me invested in them. Tanjiro is is our brave, and empathetic protagonist that is willing to combat the fearsome demons, but is also capable of showing compassion for his enemies. Fortunately, Tanjiro's compassion doesn't extend quite as far as most shonen protagonists', so it isn't grating. Meanwhile, Nezuko's condition relegates her to a mute character, but this anime still finds a way to keep her interesting with her demonstrative face in addition to the expressive voice acting (in the sub at least). The primary villain, while still an enigma, is still compelling and intimidating based on the few scenes we're given. As with any anime, the two main characters encounter and befriend allies that manage to remain distinct from one another, yet still a bit unoriginal if I have to be honest. Despite this, I've found myself quickly enjoying them as well.\n\n(ANIMATION & SOUNDTRACK) The best part of this anime for me has to be its interesting animation and mesmerizing soundtrack. This anime has quite a distinct art style that will definitely make it one to remember especially when compared to the other anime series that have been introduced this year. Each character design is unique, making it easy to distinguish characters from one another. The fight scenes are where the animation stands out the most for me. The art compliments the fighting style of each characters as it makes use of bold lines and attractive colors, somewhat reminiscent of Japanese ukiyo-ye. The music fits well with each environment we are introduced to in this anime and has yet to disappoint. \n\nIf you're into action anime with a bold, sword-wielding protagonist, you'll probably like this anime. If you're looking for a well-animated series with an memorable moments, you'll probably like this anime as well. Anyone may find this anime enjoyable as long as they remain patient. You may find the first two episodes a bit slow (I didn't, but apparently some people did), but I recommend you try to continue. You likely won't regret it!\n              """,Demon Slayer
EyeViewer,"b""\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba, the manga drawn and written by Koyoharu Gotouge, has broken sales records since Ufotable handled his adaptation.\n\nThe plot easily places us in context and pre-establishes what the rest of the story will be, approximately. The popularity of such anime can generate a contrary expectation or it can misplace people making them think that it is about an indisputably perfect story, hence many disappointments and people saying that such is overrated. Although his story is not perfect and may have subjectivity conflicts with comedy and / or clumsiness that break the immersion; Kimetsu no Yaiba triumphs by letting you know in advance, with\n                  ...\n          a generic plot, that his adventure scales all the predictable peaks of Shonen and tales of revenge. What do I want to get to ?: Kimetu no Yaiba, before his story begins, explains that it is not a mixed and creative Shonen, but for the most temporary and nescient entertainment you can have. Nor do I say that the work depends on the ignorance of the interpreter, but that, like all existing authentic stories, it depends on a correct idea so that it is not seen from an inadvisable angle.\n\nI know here I am already delivering a stupid reputation by saying that its story is authentic when it is an anime popularly criticized for being generic. Let me explain my point first. If Kimetsu no Yaiba is popularly criticized for being generic, then it is not generic, but genuinely generic. It has scattered components of the power levels and abilities that try to be unique to avoid a plagiarism drama, however, Ufotable has an important role here and, that role, is to make a story almost empty of shock have remarkable and appreciable moments. This anime does not give all its essence through its story, but through the fireworks that color the clear black sky with colors that make it a memorable experience.\n\nThe story, before the main factor, is the contributing factor so that the animation and soundtrack studio have the necessary pillars for an explosion of shocking moments to take place. If you remember Yuru Camp or Angel's Egg, you are immediately remembering animes that may have flaws or a decent story at most, but whose production turns it into works of art that try to catch the viewer so that, at the same time, they can witness a story coherent.\n\nThe concept is basic, it shows the demons in their most natural behavior, excluding Nezuko, who is the protagonist's sister. It stands to reason, by human instinct, that demons are evil and humans are weak in relative strength and can even exhibit supernatural powers. Again, Kimetsu no Yaiba delivers concepts understandable to the naked eye to make it an easily digestible experience. Just by reading his plot and understanding the charismatic personality of Tanjiro, the author takes us into an experience where we already differentiate good from evil and, with this, we already have full confidence in the victorious end of its protagonist. This is not an error nor is it a defect; Besides, the only thing that should matter to us in such a story is not the beginning or the end, as I said before, it is an important factor so that the viewer does not enter with lateral expectations.\n\nIf we talk about the story and its general structure, it follows the structure of a conventional Shonen distributed by arcs that go from weak opponents to the greatest final enemy, progressing and concluding in a possible climax. Kimetu no Yaiba follows this same structure throughout the season and possibly all 207 chapters of the manga. Here, what makes Kimetsu no Yaiba more exceptional is his evolutionary rhythm, adding new characters and showing us the origin of their behaviors. While personalities may feel illogical at first, characters are not given depth at the wrong times. Every character has his flashback moment and, after exploring the memories of him, we regain consciousness and he surprises us with a good final development. And while characters like Zenitsu have this illogical complex in their expectations, other characters will be introduced in more serious and grim ways with unique characteristics that will pique your interest before their flashback moment.\n\nAfter a battle, the conclusion does not feel victorious, but rather like a dark adventure where each character is moved against the grain by an obligation of revenge and permanence, there is no thirst for lust staining the objectives of each character. And, what's more, here not even the viewer is able to capture a feeling of triumph, since we are shown the past of the demons who want to face the main cast. It is not a fight in which you wish to the death the victory of a character, but rather goes on a more genuine path and chooses to make you feel the desire that each one does not run into a destiny stained with tragedy.\n\nNow if we talk about this anime in general, it is one that is worth watching or at least giving it a try. I am aware that it has things that could divert some people, so your enjoyment with this one is not guaranteed, but if you want to be amazed with a brutal production and outstanding moments, this is the first one that I would recommend.\n              """,Demon Slayer
pablillo96,"b'\n                A true masterpiece of recent years. This series has a quality that I have rarely seen in anime. Simply outstanding.\n\nThe story hooks you from chapter 1 and makes you want to see more when it\'s over. For me, almost all the chapters were very short to see and left me with a great feeling to discover what will happen in the next one. The structure of the chapters is very well maintained so that not a single dialogue or scene becomes tedious or difficult to visualize. \n\nThe animation is incredible, taking care of everything in detail, which greatly increases the value of the visual experience.\n                  ...\n          It\'s amazing how they manage to make the water areas, the trees, the mountains, the sky, look like real life recordings. Incredible CGI work, and also without abusing it, since the fights and action scenes in the foreground are 100% drawn. The animation, therefore, is very clear and develops in a very natural way. It is undoubtedly the highlight of this anime, along with obviously its plot.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very successful, managing to put you in tension when necessary and relax when the ""storm"" is over.\n\nThe characters are very charismatic and in my opinion there is not a single one that is useless. Each and every one of them fulfills their role perfectly, which makes it a very good quality adaptation.\n\nTo sum up, a 100% recommended series. Seeing it has been, worth the redundancy, a great experience.\n              '",Demon Slayer
K1N0SUKE,"b'\n                *Contains minor spoilers*\nSummary:\nI\'ve read the whole manga after finishing season 1 and can\'t wait for the rest of the series to be animated.  The emotion that the author is trying to express in this story was perfectly delineated and the character development throughout the series is amazing.  What makes this amazing is that the series won\'t be dragged on forever and actually comes to an end.  The ending could\'ve been better but I\'m 100% satisfied with the battles.  The art is over the top but there\'s too much yelling in the anime however that\'s how it is so I\'m not so\n                  ...\n          particular in that.  There\'s almost no unlikable characters, all of the characters are so lovable, even the ones you thought you hated at the start.  At the beginning, getting to know the demon\'s backstory\'s got repetitive but then it was still worth knowing because of how it lead up to me hating Muzan even more haha but that\'s just a personal opinion of mine.\n\nFull Review:\nDemon Slayer is such a masterpiece for those who like to be emotionally invested to a Shounen anime. The first noticable thing about this show is that the CGI sometimes looks unbelievably realistic such as the foregrounds, backgrounds, skyviews, the moon, the sun, the trees and more. Camera movements and character movements are also top-notch and the details are excellent.\n\nThe plot is simple and easy to understand. It\'s a typical shounen where our protagonist starts out as a weak character, gets trained to become the strongest character ever to avenge their lost ones, etc. But the great thing about this anime is that (knowing from the manga) it won\'t be stretched out for so long that watchers will get sick and tired of it (I wouldn\'t have). For those who prefer animes that are long, but not *too* long, this anime will be for you.\n\nThe character developement in this show is too much. Too much goodness, that is. If you\'re open minded, you may find yourself liking all of the characters for several different reasons because these characters just capture your heart. Whether it\'s for their personalities, their backstories, their looks, there seems to always be a reason to like a character in this show. You might even find your favourite character to be a demon. The one and only person I dislike is Muzan but that\'s just because maybe I\'m not open-minded enough to bring myself to like him and one other demon (I will not mention due to spoilers) but there are sooo many respectable, lovable characters in this series and makes the show worth watching.\n\n\nAll of KNY\'s soundtracks are utter masterpieces. The music they use in different scenes really really puts you in the mood. They remind me of Lord of the Rings soundtracks because of how beautiful they sound. The emotional weight they bring about is remarkable. The reason why I\'m bringing it down one score for ""sound"" is because of the yelling in the show. In my opinion, it gets annoying because sometimes the yelling becomes overused which ""over expresses"" the situation but honestly, it\'s not that big of a deal. It\'s what Demon Slayer is known for.\n              '",Demon Slayer
DeathTheKid4,"b""\n                This review will contain mild spoilers. \n\nKimetsu no Yaiba is an anime released in 2019, made after a manga from Shounen Jump. It's a standard battle shounen that was helped a lot by the fact that the studio responsible for the animation is ufotable (Fate/Zero, Fate/Stay night unlimited blade works, Tales of Zestiria etc).\n\nThe problem is that the animation quality is the only really good aspect of the anime. When you have a higher score on MAL than true masterpieces like Monster, Gurren Lagann, The Monogatari series, The Tatami Galaxy, Ping Pong The Animation or even Fate/Zero from the same studio it's clearly that something\n                  ...\n          is wrong.\n\nThe story is as basic and plain as they come, nothing really original, nothing really interesting, the arcs are repetitive, just like in My hero academia. The main characters are annoying, and they have a massive armor plot, almost at the same level of things like Fairy Tail. The main character Tanjiro at one point is given the help of his father's ghost and he learns a new technique on the spot, a completely unannounced thing, no foreshadowing at all, it just happened just for Tanjro to survive. And that is not the only ghosts that helped Tanjiro, earlier in the series, 2 ghosts of former apprentices of his master appeared and helped Tanjiro to get more powerful. Maybe it's a Star Wars reference and Tanjiro is Luke Skywalker, who knows. \n\nBasically when the author created the world in his work, I don't think he thought too far, like how to properly apply the rules of the world he created which is a shame because he breaks the very rules he created so he can get his characters new power-ups and save their lives.  \n\nThe design of the characters is also pretty basic, the worst being that of The Pillars who seem like they are directly recycled from certain characters from Bleach or Naruto. \n\nAs for the comedy, although I think comedy is subjective in general, I can't help but find the so called comedy, cringeworthy in this anime. Zenitsu in particular I think was written as a stress relief character, but in the end all he brought to the table was pure cringe. Inosuke at least is better in that aspect. \n\nThe handling of the drama is also poorly made. Basically drama in this anime translates to Tanjiro and co. almost getting killed, plot armor generated powers coming in, so the demons can finally get killed. \n\nThe animation is great, one of the best this year, I don't really have any complaints here and the soundtrack is good but pretty forgettable\n\nThis anime has become quite popular just because anime as an entertainment medium is becoming quite mainstream and Kimetsu no Yaiba acts like a gateway to anime for many new viewers, just how many of us have started with anime like Gundam, Cowboy Bebop, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, Naruto, Bleach or My Hero Academia. The difference between all these shows is that some are well written, some are not. Kimetsu no yaibase falls in category two unfortunately. \n\nAlso the argument that some give that it gets better in the manga, as the first season covers only the beginning of the story is a completely illogical and irrelevant because I only judge the anime here not the manga here and I don't judge based on future events in the manga, I judge on what happened in season one of the anime. The bottom line is that season one, which is just the beginning of the story, is nowhere near as great as some people make it seem.\n\nMy final rating is 5/10, which according to MAL ratings it means average or mediocre, and that's what I really think it was. Great animation and a nice soundtrack does not save this anime from the fact that all the other aspects are modest at best.\n              """,Demon Slayer
IceploxtheOG,"b""\n                This is how you make the best out of a mediocre genre. Shounen is known for its predictable overblown action, generic this generic that. But this show takes those generic action scenes and fucking CAAAHPLOYIES it to the moon. Every action scene is engaging, enjoying every second until its conclusion. Pair that with the stunning illustrations and sound design and you got yourself peak action scenes. \n\nI've seen how people say the story and characters are nothing special to note about but I would disagree and say that while yes they aren't the best, but they certainly are not generic. The only characters I could\n                  ...\n          agree with being generic is ramen boy and boar bog even then I would say they play the best generic roll ive seen as there are sprinkles of uniqueness in their backstory or mental situation. Which makes them compelling and goes past the stereotypes you see in other animes. The story is honestly a fresh take to me, and the encounters they face along the way and believable and charming. Is that training arc was everything you could ever want a training arc to be. The development of character and body mixed with the motivation to compel and IMPROVE! \n\nTo my mind there really isn't any negatives other than at times the cgi looking wonky and that there was minor moments that fell flat. but otherwise flawless anime in my eyes.

ChickenBakuba,"b""\n                I only finished this a month after it ended, so I understand I'm very late to the party. Nevertheless, although I don't write reviews, I felt strangely compelled to write one for this. \n\nIt appears baffling to me that many have passed Kimetsu no Yaiba off as a show with insipid writing and poor characters, with phenomenal animation as its only saving grace. Beyond the bloodshed, Kimetsu no Yaiba is a story of morality. Throughout the story, we see a recurring motif of empathy, often through the actions of Tanjiro, our protagonist.\n\nIt is the Taisho era, Japan. Tanjiro and his family dwell rurally in the\n                  ...\n          mountain, selling coal and wood to make ends meet. For reasons untold, the family live sequestered from others, save for other eccentric dwellers and a small village by the foot of the mountain. They are impoverished. Life is weary and full of graft, and yet, they are happy. \n\nTanjiro is presented concretely \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d a person of impeccable rectitude, benevolent to a fault; he works industriously as the breadwinner of his family (despite his young age) and supports his mother in raising his younger siblings. He does favours for everyone in the village freely, and splits hairs over the most minor transactions, insisting on paying even if what he has is meager. He is liked by everyone, and disliked by no one. \n\nBut happiness is transient, and disaster strikes when Tanjiro descends the mountain one day and fails to return in time. He survives only with the aid of Giyuu, a demon slayer, who berates him for his obsequiousness and helplessness. The encounter is seminal: it impresses on Tanjiro the need for strength and Giyuu the chance for something different. Giyuu is cynical, jaded. It is clear that he has seen too much in his vocation as a demon slayer, but he recommends Tanjiro to his former teacher, trusting his instinct. \n\n'...the first human every demon kills is itself.'\n\nSo enters Tanjiro, demon slayer with sword in hand and demon in tow. His very existence is paradoxical, but curiously, this antinomy allows Tanjiro to empathise with even the worst demons. Far more than pity, Tanjiro dignifies them in their final moments of quietus. He humanises them. \n\n'...they're not hideous monsters at all. Demons are hopeless creatures. They are tragic creatures!'\n\nEven shambling monstrosities who have committed deplorable atrocities seem to be no exception. When they are first presented, they appear reprehensible, and the furthest thing from a human. But as the fight progresses, tinctures of the whole picture are revealed. As the demons regain a hazy sense of human lucidity before their death, the curtains are dropped and the full picture is laid bare. A raddled writer. A confused child. The desire for human warmth, the abnegation, the stinging regret. A human connection. \n\nMake no mistake, Tanjiro understands that these demons cannot be forgiven for their deeds. When it comes down to it, he is perfectly willing to unsheathe his steel. The duality of his character is well-articulated and fleshed out. \n\nKimetsu no Yaiba was nothing short of a masterpiece. The art, animation and music elevated it to meteoric heights, but the real coping stone, to me, was the characters and the way they were developed. Moral themes and comedy are deftly interwoven into the story alongside passionate action scenes. \n\nUfotable never fails to deliver. You will enjoy this.\n              """,Demon Slayer

One instance in particular that i really like about his character is how his ideals are confronted and the thing is tanjiro has hope that his ideals will come through and we see this when he makes the deal to kill himself if nezuko ever kills a human but its not just this tanjiro's ideal can exist with others that aren't as similar for example most of the hashira hate demons and don't sympathize with them but thats ok because wether or not tanjiro or the hashira and other demon slayers sympathize witht he demons they will still make sure to kill them tanjiro's kindness is just a bonus he was able to receive by having a demon sister which makes his ideals nice to look at.10/10\n\nside characters\nall the side characters are very unique and i like that about demon slayer not just the slayers themselves but the demons too pretty much about everyone in demon slayer has a back story and like that alot because the backstories are all very different with some similarities of course however the backstories are really nice because it helps create the notion that everyone came from somewhere for example my favorite demon being rui was someone who just wanted to have a family because he thought his human family didn't love him even tho they did , regardless of their acceptance to his fragile body he felt he still needed a healthy one but it turned out bad and created his life to spiral downwards the backstories really help humanize the characters and add a lot of relatability to the story with real life implication of course someone irl isn't going to become some human eating monster but the need to be better is something very prevalent but even further the thought of needing to be better regardless of wether you are accepted or not is a nice story to represent and this is true for about 99% of demon slayer characters. the characters are by far my favorite part of demon slayer as they are very touching and its emotional impact is something amazing the comedy from characters like inosuke and zenitsu always feels right and necessary to lighten up the mood before a tragedy 10+/10\n\nenjoyment \nthis was so amazing to watch i feel like i could watch it over a million times and never get bored of it in fact i've watched it 3 times already 10+/10  \n\nanimation\nthe animation you already know is phenomenal by no means does this carry demon slayer at all but it is a nice bonus for such a masterpiece 10/10\n\nost\nagain its beautiful and such a bonus for a masterpiece 10/10\n\ntl;dr demon slayer excels at characters which is why this is so good on par with many bonuses like good animation and ost  and will surely become a classic in decades to come\n              """,Demon Slayer

I personally love following the plot of Demon Slayer (I even went out and bought the manga to continue following Tanjiro and his companions). While the story isn\'t exactly top notch, it\'s a solid 7/10.

People like to point out the fact that the story is average but sometimes an average story is all you need. The characters are all loveable (especially zenitsu) and the power system is amazing, well I mean it is breathing, but it is still nice especially the variety of the attacks. The sound is dynamic and matches\n                  ...\n          the attack, emotion, and scene perfectly. I'll say that overall the anime is enjoyable if you don't like super complex animes or romcoms.\n              """,Demon Slayer
micwong11,"b'\n                If you\'ve seen episode 19, you know.\n\nThis shit is BRILLIANT. So smooth, so colorful, so dynamic and powerful.

It\'s incredible. Not many shows can ""electrify"" you. You know the feeling. It sets in slowly, a kind of soft flicker of ""wow, this is good"" that swells into a roaring fire of ""holy fuck, I\'ll never be able to watch a fight scene again"". Well, here you go. I just made your life easier.\n\nI\'ll say it again. \n\nThis shit was brilliant. \n\n\n\n\n(some of the dialogue may be a little heavy-handed, but ehhhh)\n              '",Demon Slayer
Electrolytful,"b'\n                Once again ufotable proving they are the absolute GOAT.\n\nAnything that this studio touches with their unlimited budget works literally ends up being a masterpiece. Demon Slayer:Kimetsu no Yaiba is no exception. An absolute breathtaking journey into the world of Taisho Period Japan, with a twist. The lands are infested with man eating demons which the demon slayers (a group of elite fighters specially trained to kill demons using blades infused with special material) are then sent to dispose of. This story centers around an innocent Tanjiro who comes back home one day to find out his whole family has been brutally slaughtered, except for his\n                  ...\n          little sister Nezuko. He later finds out she has been turned into the very thing that killed his family, however she still has a tiny sense of herself and who she really is, hence protecting and accompanying her older brother in search of a way to turn her back into a human. A simple story sure, but one that is done very well and is very enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe blend of 3DCGI and 2D animation (something that ufotable is second to none at) is immaculate, especially for the breathing techniques. This is the same studio that did the Fate/stay Night and Fate/Zero series so of course the animation and fight scenes are world class. The colours used are so bright and vivid, breathing life into the beauty of Japan with its references to folklore such as Urokodaki\'s tengu mask and the gorgeous purple of the wisteria flowers.\n\nEp.19 was one of the greatest episodes of anime I have ever had the privilege of consuming. The animation and visuals were just eye-candy and the OST fit perfectly with the emotions brewing within Tanjiro throughout the series and in that particular moment. It left me literally breathless as i sat back for 20 minutes staring at the ceiling contemplating the beauty i just witnessed. \n\nThe score is just as good as the animation, with LiSA blessing our ears with the opening theme and a solid set of OST\'s by the wonderful Yuki Kajiura. What really stood out was the OST during Ep.19 titled ""Kamado Tanjiro no Uta"". Perfect for the scene with lyrics directly relating to Tanjiro and his journey through the darkness with no choice but to keep pressing onward.\n\nThe main cast of characters are really enjoyable to watch, especially the trio of Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke with some really hilarious moments and scenes. The design of the pillars are amazing, you can tell how intense and poweful they are from just looking at them. \n\nThank you ufotable for this gorgeous series, \xc3\xa3\xef\xbf\xbd\xe2\x80\x9e\xc3\xa3\xef\xbf\xbd\xc5\xb8\xc3\xa3\xef\xbf\xbd\xc2\xa0\xc3\xa3\xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd\xc3\xa3\xef\xbf\xbd\xc2\xbe\xc3\xa3\xef\xbf\xbd\xe2\x84\xa2.\n\nStory: 8\nArt: 10\nSound: 10\nCharacters: 9\nOverall: 10\n              '",Demon Slayer
AndyKyrielight,"b""\n                Ever since the passing of his father, Tanjiro Kamado has taken many responsibilities to shoulder his family. While the Kamado family lives impoverished, they are happy together living a peaceful life in the mountains. On his way back home after selling charcoal to the local village, he settles down for the night in a strangers home. The stranger warns him about the existence of dark flesh-eating creatures of the night, demons. Tanjiro arrives back home after sunrise, discovering his family to have been slaughtered. That's not all, his sister Nezuko managed to survive the slaughter, but is now a demon herself. Unable to put Nezuko\n                  ...\n          down, Tanjiro tried to get through to her, reminding her of who she was, and who he is. Astonishingly, he was able to get through to her, stopping her from killing her brother. Tanjiro now swears to have his vengeance against those who have slaughtered his family, and vows to stay by Nezuko. His journey begins with the discovery of a mysterious group, the Demon Slayer Corps.\n\nShounen anime in recent years have really been going above and beyond the shounen standards we've come to know by now. Demon Slayer, is one such example of how to buck the long running trends of shounen anime, all while still being just as bad-ass and impactful for fans.\n\nAt its core the anime is actually rather slow, something I'm sure most of us are familiar with when it comes to shounens. It does pretty much all you would expect of a modern shounen anime. Lengthy battles, an emphasis on power levels, adapting to your opponent/environment over the course of multiple episodes, dialogue during fights, you name it. Yet it manages to do all of this seamlessly with an equal amount of urgency and intensity. Every episode felt quick and eventful, as if I had just sat down to watch my episode of the week, only to feel like it ended as I sat down. when in actuality it was twenty minutes of exciting moment to moment action intricately woven together by it's plot. Guess I never got to physically sit down in the first place, since Demon Slayer had me so far on the edge of my seat I was practically standing. The only time this anime ever hard stopped or slowed down, was when the characters themselves physically needed a moment to rest and recuperate. Make no mistake though, those episodes were fantastic too, overall the pacing itself is damn near spot on, and I haven't even talked about the characters yet!\n\nI'll be focusing on mostly Tanjiro and Nezuko since the other leads show up later, and are better seen on the big screen rather than read about. I'll start with Nezuko since it's pretty straight forward, she's very adorable, endearing, and cool in combat when Tanjiro lets her out of her box. That's pretty much it though, sorry Nezuko fans, I've just got more to say about Tanjiro. Tanjiro is a good lad through and through, though there is one thing that separates him from the majority of shounen protagonists, compassion. Because of his dilemma with Nezuko, Tanjiro has a much deeper connection to the demons in this anime. That connection might not be directly, but sympathy goes a long way when he needs to cut down someone who's going through the same struggles as his beloved sister. Unlike most protagonists, they don't truly understand what their opposition has gone through, what unfair cards they have dealt, Tanjiro understands that. It's what makes Tanjiro's personal quest so captivating, for him to save his suffering loved one who is fighting just to stay in control, he must put those who have lost control to rest. Tanjiro is without a doubt in my mind, the best boy of 2019.\n\nAnything else I could talk about this anime would just come off as gushing at this point, since the anime has no obvious faults. The 2D animation is on point while also including some well thought out usage of CGI, the soundtrack is exhilarating, and the voice actors all put in a great effort! There really is no shortcoming in Demon Slayer I can think of, Ufotable put a lot of effort into making this anime the best it could be, and it worked! While my review will end here, Demon Slayer's anime won't stop here, thanks to the immediate reveal of a movie sequel coming in the near future, the Infinite Train arc. Until then, I'll be waiting, as for anyone who hasn't jumped on this hype train yet, the time is now!\n              """,Demon Slayer
DoctuhD,"b""\n                Demon Slayer knows exactly what kind of story it wants to be, and does so extremely well, but does its reliance on certain narrative crutches make for \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93bad writing?\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd\n\nMost reviewers agree that the sound, animation, and overall presentation of Demon Slayer is excellent, but the writing is more divisive. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s why this review is completely dedicated to the story. \n\nOne of the most important questions to ask when judging the writing of a story is: \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93What is it trying to do, and does it do that well?\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd While Demon Slayer might not be breaking your expectations for the action-shounen genre, it achieves its purpose incredibly\n                  ...\n          well and makes for a wonderfully entertaining story, as long as you can put up with some unrealistic interactions and sudden developments. \n\n|| Focus 10/10 ~ Masterful ||\n\nThe first 15 seconds of Demon Slayer explain almost the entire premise: This is the story of how Tanjirou will save his sister. Most of the story elements contribute to narrating Tanjirou and Nezuko\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s journey as they train in body and spirit as they grow to understand and pity the demons they fight, so the story never loses its path towards that goal. \n\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Everything supports the story\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s goals and themes\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Elevates a simple premise into an engaging plot\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Utilizes a fairly small cast of characters to great effect\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Characters consistently feel important to story events. \n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c No hot springs or beach episodes\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c No filler\n\n|| Ambition 7/10 ~ Good ||\n\nDemon Slayer avoids the worst tropes of the Shonen genre and even has a few innovations, but at the end of the day it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s still the simplistic plot you would expect from an action-shounen story, though that isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t inherently bad.\n\nI can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t express enough how much I enjoy the cooperation in Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s fights. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a few exceptions, but most of the time our heroes have to work together, protect one another, and create weaknesses for their comrades to exploit when against tough opponents. \n\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Actual cooperation in battles\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Fantasy mechanics feel consistent despite little development\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Story progresses incredibly quick for its genre, making up for the simplistic plot\n\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xcb\x9c Mechanics are so simple that you have to just accept them and move on\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xcb\x9c Plot has little intricacy\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xcb\x9c Par for the course in action-shounen\n\n|| Dialogue 6/10 ~ Fine ||\n\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Efficient in developing characters\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Moves story along quickly\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Concise, leaves more room for other things\n\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xcb\x9c Unrealistic conversations\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xcb\x9c Nezuko\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s name is shouted too often\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xcb\x9c Awkward dialogue during fights\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xcb\x9c Characters frequently react with vapid/pointless questions. (Asking a question even though the answer is obvious, e.g. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93are you awake?\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd)\n\nTanjirou has a tendency to ask unnecessary questions as a way of keeping the conversation moving down a fixed path and pointing out important details to the reader. An example of this is how Tanjirou and others will point out obvious things during fights (\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Oh no, my hair is wrapped around the axe!\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd, which isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t abnormal for action shounen, but isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t a necessary crutch when the animation is good enough to show it just fine. This is normal for its genre and isn't necessarily bad, but can be annoying.\n\n|| Structure 10/10 ~ Masterful ||\n\nDemon Slayer hones and sharpens the tropes of its genre, proving that some tropes exist for a reason and aren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t inherently bad for their stories.\n\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Humble beginnings create a great sense of progression\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Every encounter develops the world\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Fight structures are less predictable than others in genre\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Characters and plot elements introduced slowly at first to build mystery\n\xc3\xa2\xc5\x93\xe2\x80\x9c Villains backstories don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t interrupt fights, makes them harder to predict and matches emotional fallout\n\n|| Overall 8.25/10 ~ Great writing ||\n\nMost of the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xcb\x9cflaws\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 in Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s writing may seem like bad writing when isolated from their context, but when I ask myself: \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Would changing that make the story better?\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd The answer is usually \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93No.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd Sure, I would care more about the villains if they received character development before they were already dying, but that would interrupt the pacing of the fights. By doing it consistently, KnY teaches you to expect the villains to be the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93tragic, pitiful creatures\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd that Tanjirou sees them to be, and reminds you of that in the wake of every victory, which is where your emotions are most vulnerable.\n\nSure, when characters point out obvious details in fights it goes against \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93show don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t tell.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd But they also focus the action on the most important events and those thoughts anchor us to the characters\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 perspectives and make the fight immersive. Even though such a thing isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t realistic, it makes for a much better story. The series clearly displays a talent for \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93show don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t tell\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd through how it develops its characters through details, behaviors, and design, but that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a separate discussion entirely. How much people like Shinobu despite a relatively small amount of screentime should be a testament for the series\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 writing philosophy.\n\nWhile it may seem confusing that Nezuko is gagged and unable to talk whereas the other demons converse freely, the symbolism of the bamboo muzzle as a thematic comparison to a Buddhist monk\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s vow of silence, as well as her unique condition make her to be a strong character in her own right whose muteness is a reminder of the struggle to retain her humanity. Sure, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a plot device to keep the focus on Tanjirou as the protagonist, but it makes the story better.\n\nFinally, while there are instances where Tanjirou suddenly gains a new ability, but they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re forgivable because if we knew he had them before, they would be the Chekhov\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s gun and make the fight more predictable. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s more enjoyment to be gained in a story by having this character growth frequently come in during fights, instead of always during long training arcs, even if that was more realistic. Demon Slayer makes this growth canon, as well as thematic, with the expression of how near-death experiences pull at your long-forgotten memories. Thematically, this enhances the frequent connection between memories and one\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s humanity that makes all the flashbacks in the series more meaningful. \n\nIn conclusion:\n\nIf you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re going into Demon Slayer expecting novel-quality writing or don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t like the action-shounen genre at all, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re going to be disappointed. However, if you like the type of story the genre is capable of telling but can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t get into them because of their cliches and slow pacing, then Demon Slayer will almost definitely impress. It avoids cliches, leans into its tropes, and crafts a gripping story from fairly simple-seeming characters.  Due to how well its apparent flaws actually enhance the story\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s focus, I would say that Demon Slayer has flawed but still excellent writing because of how it tells Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s story in the most entertaining way possible.\n\n// Story: 8 // Art: 10 // Sound: 10 // Character: 8 // Enjoyment: 10 // Overall: 10 //\n              """,Demon Slayer
Alphyx,"b'\n                This might contain some spoilers, \n\nI\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve always had a bad habit to procrastinate doing many things, but I solely believe that this habit, in particular, is what enables me to enjoy a piece of content to the best of its capacity.\n\nAnd the highly acclaimed title Kimetsu no Yaiba \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Demon Slayer (it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s better-known counterpart) is no exception. I knew it was great, having watched snippets of its epic scenes on YouTube I was convinced that this would be one of the better series to close out the decade of 2010-2020. But it was only after starting to set aside the time to binge the series\n                  ...\n          did I understand why the popularity of this anime is so tremendous. Just like Shingeki no Kyojin, its popularity is justified. Simply being, SNK was great due to its originality and world-building. KNY (Kimetsu no Yaiba) shines in its amazing cast of characters and their backgrounds where the entirety of the narrative revolves around the characters which they feature. Both with a different focus and yet they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re both great masterpieces in their own right. Some might say that the writing for this anime is poorly done, but to be fair if you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re able to see things from the author\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s point of view or perhaps obtain a workaround on viewing things from a perspective other than your own. Maybe then you could understand why this anime is such a masterpiece.\n\nNow let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s get started with an actual review of this great anime known as Demon Slayer. As a writer, how would you know if you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve made an impression on your audience, at the very first episode no less? That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s right, you start by kicking them straight in feels, playing everything out as a happy go lucky type of setting just to be thrown into the shit moments after. Don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t get me wrong, this isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t the recipe for success but the way the author made the setting complemented the theme so well that it felt second nature to the series as a whole. The first episode alone is enough to send shivers down your spine because of its implicit and no-nonsense approach. The foreshadowing and tease from the extras was merely the start of what the audience can expect.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbdThe great calm before a mighty storm\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and the writer delivered this marvellously.\n\n\nBut every story has to start somewhere and the writer wasted no time planting a convenient yet effective method, the main character and his family but what can the writer do to ensure that the protagonists continue their journey relentlessly? That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s right, by instating a purpose and a raison d\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2etre to ensure that there is an end goal to meet alongside the expectation of something more or rather to the light at the end of the tunnel. Now to begin, the main theme of this show is actually familial warmth and the bonds we share as individuals living together. Whether we like it or not, we cannot choose nor can we change how other people act but we can change ourselves for the better. Be it love for oneself or love for another, the author is able to pen down her thoughts rather effectively and trigger the tender heartstrings of her audiences well. And make no mistake, this isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t your typical Nakama Power nonsense. People often joke about how Naruto uses Talk no Jutsu (it has become a full-fledged meme at this point) well guess what, the Main Character in this series exploits the power of his mind to overcome the many obstacles ahead.\n\nMaybe the author herself understands that everything within us as humans are only limited by ourselves. The mind is a very powerful tool and what limits us is our very own thoughts and expectations, when we remove what we could potentially accomplish or cannot do we are setting an expectation over an intended result. But this is different when we just ignore our limiters to attempt something rather than just thinking. This itself is a dangerous thought but the results may at times surprise you. This is interesting because of how real this actually is. If the people in our current era forsake the thought of what if I fail and ignore the cannot\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s and just focus on the do\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d get far more results and greater successes. That is quite frankly how our Main Character is able to push forward even when the odds are stacked so ridiculously against him. The bonds that he shares are just that much stronger than the forces opposing him. The human mind is able to overcome the most impossible of odds when faced with a life and death situation. Our desperate attempts to stay alive is the depiction of the last vestiges of our existence, it is what causes strange phenomenons to take form which again highlights our greatest attribute as human beings. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Our ability to adapt.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd\n\nHumans are weak, that is why we band together to form communities. It is an undeniable fact as shown through our history. It is essential for our survival, in this show the demon counterparts are the representation of strength the direct opposite of weakness. Which is why they seek to work alone and be solitary. (This is further explored on in potential seasons/manga) (but we will not touch on that here)\nThe genius in Kyoharu Goutoge\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s narrative is that she is able to create characters with relatable stories and backgrounds which in turn causes the audience to sympathise and empathise with. In turn, it also depicts that everyone has a lot in life, and not all are blessed that is why we humans are \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xcb\x9cUnequal\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2. When we are born, we just have to accept what we are given and live with it. Do not complain that the rules are unfair because nothing in this world is. And Kyoharu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s writing will ease this concept into the very depths of your mind as you watch the series moving forward.\n\nFrom the very first episode, everything is thrown into a spiral and thus our Protagonist begins on his arduous journey in a venture of something that is quite possibly impossible. The story alone is very touching and heart-wrenching, it is almost as if the writer herself has been part of such tragedies and or rather is exposed/made known to them. She is able to find a purpose to reason and justify why bad things happen, a factor, a situation, everything in constant, one final outcome. Everything happens for a reason but why do things turn out differently when the same situation is pitted amongst others? Because every individual is different, we all have our own problems and we face them differently. This show does a damn good job in depicting this.\n\nThe story starts out in a very fluid way, every episode covers important aspects for the plot to progress. For how dark this show actually is, the writer incorporates light-humour to offset the extreme negative feelings brought about by the show as it moves forward. One of the main highlights of why Kimetsu no Yaiba is such a masterpiece is that the writer has an absurd cast of characters and for her to come up with background stories for almost every one of them is mindblowing. Every villain in the series has a background story, not sure if this was the writer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s intention to justify why people do bad things. But everyone has to start somewhere and bad things can happen to anyone.\n\nIt is more of how we cope with them moving forward. Kyoharu utilises the transition between her narrative well, from action into recovery and into world-building. I would say that this is a recipe for success, given that the series never felt boring even for a second. It was extremely engaging, not to mention hilarious given the side characters interactions depicted a touch of humanity in a world where demons roam it helps to have these short bits of comedy to keep things light. It refreshes the audience\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s mood for what is to come next. I am unable to delve much into the story without spoiling it but the narrative is written in such a way that people behave in such a way that they do is mainly due to the circumstances that they are in. We do not choose to be where we are but we can choose to become who we want to be.\n\nThe art in this anime is simply mind-boggling, it felt as though they had the budget to create another season of attack on titan. Imagine a series rivalling an anime that is arguably going to be the anime of the decade. That alone is pretty insane, the attention to details for the characters, environment and effects is simply outstanding. It wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be exaggerating to say that this anime could potentially be the next Shingeki no Kyojin. Although the tone and approach are different its popularity is undeniable, the music is well done and quite simply extremely fitting for the tone and setting of this anime. It is unsettling when it needs to be, light-hearted when required and epic when needed. The openings and ending are sung by LiSA nuff said. Not to mention the character song that is played when one of the epic fights occurred no wonder the author herself cried, it was really one of the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Caption Moments in Anime History.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd\n\nNeedless to say, I freaking enjoyed this anime, I mean I can totally see myself rewatching this again and again without ever feeling bored or unimpressed. It is just that good, the characters are very interesting each and every one of them provides a different perspective and there is always more than what meets the eye. If you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve not seen the background story for that character, don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t sell them short it isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t because they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t have one. It is just that they haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t gotten their chance to showcase it. When you have the audience loving not just the main characters but the side characters you know you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve got a great piece of work here. BUT to go a step further, to make your audience empathise and like even the antagonists now that is awe-inspiring. It isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t easy to create likeable characters and Kyoharu is able to imagine and create an assembly of likeable casts left and right. It almost feels like it is second nature to her, it is simply astounding. When you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re exposed to content like this, you know that you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve got a binge-worthy series on your hands. Given how this anime takes no chill to another level, you will always be on a roller coaster of emotions.\n\nIn terms of its depth, there are many things that can be learnt from this anime but let us cover a few that Kyoharu has so graciously outlined for us the audience. Good and bad, are two sides of the same coin, how can we determine which is right from wrong? Who gets to decide that? The fact remains that we as individuals dictate what we should think and how we should feel, not based on what people tell us. It is true that the strong get to decide what happens and the weak can only cower in fear if they refuse to fight back. Because if you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t try you will never know if you could have done something differently or made a difference in your situation. At times when the forces against us are so overwhelming that we start to despair, it is easy to let the fear settle in and cloud our judgement it is only until much later that we regret our actions and start to realise the folly of our decision. But once you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve made a mistake does that mean that you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re forever lost? Is there no chance of redemption?\n\nNo, there is always a turning point but you must be brave enough to take the first step. Because at the end of the day, it is us and only us who can change ourselves to rely on others to do it for us is simply pathetic. Because even when it succeeds the results are not borne through your individual efforts it was forced out of you by another. Can you truly say that you lived that life? Or rather did what you wanted to? To live without regrets, one must first believe that within themselves on what they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re doing is truly right and just. Sometimes circumstances force us to become what we are not, but if things turn out the way they are who then is able to determine if that they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re doing is truly wrong? What seems wrong to you might seem right to me, to judge without considering both perspectives is wrong. There is an abundance of hidden meanings and depth to be derived from this series and to cover it all would require serious discussion, but to stay on track let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just say that everything happens for a reason.\n\nNeedless to say, a budgetless series like Kimetsu no Yaiba is practically exposed to one of the most stacked Voice Acting casts I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve ever witnessed, even the extras and side characters are voiced by very prominent VA\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s within their field of expertise, when you have the likes of Kaji Yuki, Kana Hanazawa, Hayami Saori, Sakurai Takahiro, Shimono Hiro. You know that you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll be in for a treat. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a reason why these individuals are all prominent VA\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s. The studio would never go to such expenses to hire such talent to waste away, this just goes to show how big a potential this series held and how much it is loved by even the cast for them to want to be part of it even as a side character no less.\n\nEven when the narrative at times starts becoming predictable, you almost always feel for the main characters and want them to come out ahead, but when they do you start feeling bad for their opponents even though they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been so threatening just moments ago. Every scene and combat brings about tremendous growth for our cast and it helps to develop the series into a gem among gems. The main antagonist is something else, the unsettling feeling that he brings about and how he is the main reason we even have this series is a testament to how great a character he is. Overall, the anime generally takes on a pretty dark tone but the author is able to create silly situations to distract the audience from it. Almost as if to depict that, even within the darkest depths you can still search for the light and eventually is shines just as brightly as ever before.\n\nI absolutely loved the series and can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t wait for its sequel, I know for a fact that the upcoming movie will just be an enabler for Season 2. I am extremely hyped and can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t wait to feast my eyes on this absolute treasure.\n\nA definite recommendation for anyone out there that seeks to watch a great piece of work, perhaps even one of the greatest anime of all time.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Sine-Pai,"b""\n                Demon Slayer, the biggest hit of the new anime that came out in 2019. \n\nStory: \nClassic shounen, it's simple and straight forward, so no plot twists or anything tbh, therefore it's quite predictable, but still, the narration is well paced. \n\nArt: \nHey come on, it's ufotable, 9/10 is even an understatement to the fantasic animation that the staff has produced. \nThe blend of 3D and 2D fight scenes are just perfect, it's just on another tier compare to other anime series out there. \nThe water breathing really gives you that ukiyoe kind of feeling, and it's been executed perfectly\n\n                  ...\n          Sound & music: \nStill, outstanding sound effects, you can literally feel the different breathing techniques\nThe op Gurenge by LiSA was amazing, the song from episode 19 Kamado Tanjiro no Uta was amazing, the ed was good, totally satisfied\n\nCharacter:\nCharacters have their depth, even the demons have good background stories, everything justifies their actions. \nI think the construction of Tanjiro's character was good, he is yasashi, but he is not a sanctimonious dude, unlike some other characters who let the evil survive because the villans will be rEfOrMeD\nso, well done\n\nEnjoyment: \nEasy 10/10 for me, I was totally sinked into the story, but keep in mind, the enjoyment is based on personal experience. \n\nSo overall, a 10/10 for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\n              """,Demon Slayer
PiereDelecto,"b""\n                Demon Slayer is a visual treat with beautiful sound to back it up. The story is basically a venn diagram of Naruto, Bleach, Shaman King, Tokyo Ghoul, and Inuyasha. A decent distillation of the good stuff with tolerable trope-creep and superior pacing. Except for Zenitsu - he's an unbearable looney toon and hopefully they tone that guy down in future seasons.\n\nShould YOU watch it?\n\nThe first five episodes are top notch in all dimensions. The world is built beautifully, the key characters engage us, the tone is set to mature and mysterious, future directions are tantalizing. Everything stews together perfectly and starts to smell amazing. Beautiful\n                  ...\n          artwork, compelling themes, lovely sound, great animation - and a zero-to-hero training arc that is as good as they can get, I suppose. But in the fifth episode a clear shift in direction put me on the fence...\n\nBehind the first door, the show may live up to the promise of the first five episodes and I would be happy I kept watching. Behind the second, the forgettable shonen formula wrings all the special sauce out of the manga, which I don't ever plan to read, and serves us the rest with a sprinkle of badass fight scenes to entice us into consuming trash. Thankfully it lived up to my hopes many times and only lapsed into garbage territory breifly in ways that don't matter that much. The Gotei-9 for example were absurdly lame, but they're only on screen long enough to screw up half an episode. The fight scenes were VERY badass, and spread in a thick layer across the entire season rather than sprinkled with a cherry on top of episode 19. While our main character is a bit of a wet blanket and his crew as useful as urinal cakes, between Nezuko and the bad guys it works out. \n\nMy take is that you will not be disappointed with the quality of the first five episodes, and will see in that time exactly what the show has to offer. Can't go wrong up to that point. Demon Slayer feels just a bit unique, and to me it's greatest strength is the atmospheric art + sound + animation combo that really breathes life into the demonic abilities of opponents and makes a spectacle of the fight against them. Add to this the flashback sequences we get that humanize the demons, and we've definitely got a deeper battle-shonen here than most.\n              """,Demon Slayer
gengrie,"b'\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba/Demon Slayer: I loved it! \nPLEASE NOTE: I\'m not new to the shounen scene at all, however I do tend to prefer things like romance and comedy, so I\'m about 90% qualified to leave a review. Keep that in mind!\n\nStory: 9 - Cause it was kinda generic. Never seen before...but also generic. But did I like it? Hell yeah! Only one point off because I\'m not gonna be a hypocrite.\n\nArt: 10 - Great lighting aesthetic, and the colors managed to be so dark yet VIBRANT!\n\nSound: 10 - I watched with a surround sound system, and oh boy, that was bone chilling!!!\n\nCharacter: 9 -\n                  ...\n          Point off for ""GeNeRiCnEsS"" with some of the characters (you\'re gonna hear that a lot). I understand that shounen sees that their fans like the ""with the power of [insert something, preferably friends, family, or strength], I will become very overpowered!!!"" and kinda milk it for that reason, but like I said earlier, I\'m missing 10% of ""qualified"", so I\'ll sorta let it slide...\n\nEnjoyment: 10 - I had a blast watching this series. Sure, there are a few flaws, but overall, it was so fun to watch. I also give this a 10 because of how much/often I had to force myself to watch it: never! I didn\'t have to force a second of watching!\n\nOverall: 9 - I liked this series a lot because of the clear amount of creativity and effort put in, but it did have things that made me take a point off.\n\nWatch this series if you like shounen, action, fighting, and bright colors.\nDon\'t watch if you like no plot/story, slow and easygoing, and something TOTALLY new. I will also say that this anime should not be your first; it will set your expectations kind of high.\n              '",Demon Slayer
lilkraken,"b'\n                *Review contains spoilers*\n\nStory 10/10\nBe prepared for action anime with unexpected, highly emotional twists. The story is about Tanjirou, who was a parentified child (meaning: caring too much weight on his shoulders already), finding his family massacred by demons, with one sister as the lone survivor. To make matters worse, this sister has been transformed into a demon herself. Right off the bat you think \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93holly shit, what is he going to do with all of this now?\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and by \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93this\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd I mean having virtually no family, no one to go too and having to decide whether to kill his sister or save her, which in\n                  ...\n          fact, he never hesitated what he would do (hearts, hearts). He decides to protect his sister at all cost and become a demon slayer himself.\nWhat I really liked about this anime is the originality of its script and how well the characters are presented for you to fall in love with them and their story. We see Tanjirou overcome whatever struggle is presented to him, but we also see his sister be a \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93different demon\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd, refraining from harming humans and actually helping defeat demons. I really loved their relationship and how they always had each other\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s back. I wished my brothers would love me as much!\n\nArt 10/10\nThis is definitely not my forte, but this anime looked pretty good to me. So many good scenes!! I loved everything, from the designs used with the characters to the colors used on them and backgrounds. This anime, as far as anime drawings can get, felt realistic to me.\n\nSound 9/10\nI am a fan of the opening. Obviously, I had no idea what they were saying, but the song has stuck with me for weeks after I finished the anime. And obviously too, I had to google the translation and it goes too well to summarize the anime itself. \n\nCharacters 9/10\nThe only reason this section is not getting a 10 is because of Zenitsu and most of the Hashiras, excepting Tomioka. The Hashiras are just a very weird assemble of characters, most of them annoying for either being too extravagant or just plain mean.  Zenitsu I found annoying because he was whining 95% of the times and, when conscious, was just a drag. However, I must say I found it hilarious that he would go unconscious under extreme fear or pressure, would be a superb fighter while \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93sleeping\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and would not remember anything he did while unconscious. I would have preferred him to be asleep for longer time and maybe he would have been less annoying! (I hope this doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t get explained as a trauma, because then I would feel sorry for saying he is annoying). I am still at lost as to why Inosuke wears a head of a boar most of the time too. Explanations anyone?\nOn a positive note, I was moved by Zenitsu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s last moments after fighting the spider group and applaud how smart he was to think of how to prevent blood flowing too much and the venom killing him. \nTanjirou is as interesting and as strong as a lead character should be. I think Tanjirou is mature beyond his years. I am an adult and I can tell you that finding my whole family massacred like that would have thrown me into an existential crisis. But somehow, he found strength to overcome the situation and protect his sister against all odds. Tanjirou is such a sweet and pure soul that he even felt sorry for the demons and would show them mercy and forgiveness. \nNezuko is another brilliant character. I was moved by most of the scenes involving her as she mostly came out of Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s backpack to protect her brother. And just the fact that he carries his sister in a backpack for her own protection is heartwarming!!\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6I also loved how Nezuko proved herself to the Hashiras!!\nI was glad to see Tanjirou had so much support from Tomioka and Sakonji. They give him the guidance and tough love needed for him to grow under the circumstances. \nOn a side note, was I the only one feeling sorry for Rui by the end?\n\nEnjoyment 10/10\nThis anime had me on high alert all the time while watching. Episodes 19 and 20 were jaw dropping for me! Felt all the feels and more. I really enjoyed Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s and Nezuko\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s relationship and each character\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s journey of growth and development. I can only hope following seasons are as good.\n\nOverall 10/10\nI would highly recommend this anime as I haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t been able to find a flaw or a \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93but\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd in it, which, if you check my other reviews, I most certainly always do!\n              '",Demon Slayer
HellLyter,"b'\n                Demon Slayer is the latest shounen anime to grace the medium with it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s presence and gain a surge of popularity and praise. And you know, this shounen actually deserves it! The competent writing, endearing characters, Ufotable visuals and music by Yuki Kajiura just screams recipe for success.  Yet despite this agglomeration of positive elements, this series was only able to be just good in my eyes. There were just several bad decisions and areas where the anime failed to reach its potential for me to call it truly great.\n\nLet\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s start off with the highlight of this anime: The epic visuals. Ufotable once again proves\n                  ...\n          that they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re one of if the the most competent anime studio out there by providing some truly breathtaking art and animation. And they know they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re good, and you can totally see them flexing in some sequences just to be like \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93yeah, we can do that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and I just love it. One of the biggest complaints an anime can get is using cgi, yet Ufotable is able to seamlessly implement cgi mechanics into Demon Slayer, and sometimes it fits so well that you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even notice that cgi is even being used. Their grasp on environments is simply masterful, especially when animating combat scenes. The battle between Tanjirou and the Drum Demon was memorable simply because of how Ufotable handled the rotating rooms. And speaking of battles, don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even get me started on the conclusion of the Tanjirou vs Rui fight. The combination of the crisp animation, perfect camera angles, and unique art used on Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s sword was probably the peak of the anime. And honestly, the art used on Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s sword when he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s using combat arts throughout the entire show has to be one of the most visually pleasing things I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve seen in an anime. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just so cool and soothing to witness. Now I could go on and on about this show\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s visuals, but I won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t subjugate you further to my fanboying, so let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s move on!\n\nOf course we shouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t let the fantastic visuals eclipse the sound work done by Yuki Kajiura. She once again proves why she\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s one of the best in the industry by producing a fitting and memorable selection of music. The more traditional sounds, particularly the chanting used in the main theme and other pieces, just fits so well with the style of Demon Slayer. And of course having Lisa on the theme songs is an added bonus! The seiyuu are a good bunch, and I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m particularly fond of Nezuko\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s grunts for some reason. Of course, it does sometimes feel like the voice actors go a little overboard. Looking at you Hiro (Zenitsu) and Yoshitsugu (Inosuke)! But overall, they do a fine job.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\nAnime has a knack for creating kawaii imouto characters, and Nezuko is no exception. This girl might not be one for words, but she\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s still won over the hearts of many. The poor girl was turned into a demon after a family tragedy, but unlike most demons, she defends humans instead of eating them thanks to the strong bond with her brother Tanjirou. She even helps him fight off other demons. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s right, she protec. She attac. But most importantly, she fit in backpac! That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s right, this demon girl has the ability to change her size for easy transportation! How convenient! Though you know what one of the best things about her is? The portrayal of the relationship with her Onii-chan. A lot of anime featuring a brother and sister pair usually include an actual sexual attraction from one to another. And while I usually find that to be cute, I like how Demon Slayer took a different approach and showcased a more, uh...""healthier"" type of sibling relationship. The love between them just feels genuine, and they way that Tanjirou and Nezuko support each other through the show has to be one of the best things about it. \n\nI mentioned in the beginning how there are some things keeping this anime from being great in my eyes. The most prominent of these for me would be that Demon Slayer just takes some things too far. Let me elaborate with some examples.\n\nZenitsu is clearly the comic relieve guy. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a major coward and a bit of a womanizer. Honestly, the comedy of Demon Slayer mostly falls flat for me, but I do find Zenitsu to be humorous. Especially thanks to the comedic way he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s animated sometimes. But the show just goes too far with his antics in some instances that put him in the annoying category. And in some serious scenes, like when a bloody kid dies in Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s arms, the next scene is literally Zenitsu being funny. Moments like this just feel like terrible timing to me, and I feel like the dude would have been a lot better if he was toned back some. Regardless, I still like him as a character.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\nIt\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s common in shounen anime for the protagonist to think about literally everything that happens in a battle. This is useful in letting we the viewers know what\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s going on and stuff. But my man Tanjirou takes this to another level. There are so many times when the dude is just standing around facing a threatening demon going over so many things in his head without actually fighting that it can get somewhat aggravating. I mean it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s okay to just swing your sword at a demon from time to time without monologuing about what form your using, how you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re breathing, and how exactly you\'re going to attack every single time!\n\nFinally, I wasn\'t sure how to feel about the humanization of literally every demon. While I like that it adds depth to these monsters and shows that they too were once human, it\'s kinda hard to feel for them after they\'re shown brutally murdering people with no remorse and only showing any semblance of human emotion after their chopped off heads slowly fall to the ground. I could better justify this if only a select few demons were given a lot of screen time and depth and thus a reason to have a tragic backstory or whatever, but all of them? I just don\'t think it works.\n\nDespite flaws like these, Demon Slayer has many good things going for it. For one, I really like how Demon Slayer deals with training arcs. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s common in shounen for the weak protagonist to work at getting stronger by developing new skills by working under a master, but there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just something about how it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s executed in this anime that makes it stand above most of the rest in my eyes. Especially the second training arc where Tanjirou learns total concentration breathing at Shinobu Kochou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s house. Though I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d be lying if I said that the three supportive lolis weren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t a big reason for why I liked the arc so much\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6Honestly, Demon Slayer has the best training arcs that I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve seen in a shounen since HunterXHunter.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Also, the second half of the anime really picks up in terms of plot and character growth. The fights are better, the stories behind the demons are better, and even loud, boisterous Inosuke gets humbled, showing that even wild boar men can develop! \n\nDemon Slayer is a really solid anime. It took the typical shounen approach with a few twists and made something really good out of it. Sure, it might have relied on the ""monster of the week"" formula a little too much and have characters who definitely need more development, but there\'s a lot more source material out there to solve problems like these. Now we just got to hope that Ufotable will give us a sequel somewhere down the line.\n              '",Demon Slayer
AdamozoCZ,"b'\n                Despite any reluctance you might have to watch the show - maybe because it seems like a very generic shounen, maybe because it gained a huge amount of hype you start being sceptical about it, maybe the whole demon slaying thing is not your thing - Demon Slayer is truly a noteworthy piece that will go down the history of anime as one of the classics, I\'m sure.\n\nEvery show is like a burger, which means it is composed of very crucial ingredients, and lack of a single one of them makes up for a very nasty sandwich.\n\nLet\'s start with the most important ones: THE BUNS\n                  ...\n          (aka the story). Many shounen buns are the same. You enjoy them, they taste good, they are what makes burger a burger, yet you would welcome some slight variety. In the case of the Demon Slayer, they have some minor difference to them. The story itself is cohesive, does not dawdle too much and has the right amount of comedy snuck into it at the right time. The premise is pretty simple; hunt some demons, but the fact that the show is not stagnant, and the enemies in it scale up in strength after each battle, already proves to be more diverse than most shounen shows. So the story has an actual journey and not just ""fight-relax-fight"" arcs where none of the characters develop at all.\nIt would not be a burger without a proper chunk of MEAT (aka the characters). There are instances where the meat is undercooked, it is something Gordon Ramsey would yell at. And you get salmonela. The distaste lingers in your mouth hours after consuming it. Fortunately, this meat is juicy and warm. Neither raw nor hard to chew. The progress of characters is clearly there. That is the most defining element of long-running work where you expect things to change. With this it already rivals its big brothers, FMA:B and Hunter x Hunter. All characters have backstory, which is not dragged out and offering the viewer a look into the past of both good and bad guys. The anime also blurs the line between the good and the bad in its revealing of the past. That does not derail Demon Slayer from capturing its evil, for there is a very defined dislikable villain from the beginning.\nIf you only add some piece of bread and meat, you are essentially having a grill party. That on its own isn\'t bad, but we want that good sandwich. What do we do? We add the VEGETABLES (aka the art, the visuals). Fresh lettuce, some onion, tomatoes, pickles, you name it! Now, you can wipe that sweat off your forehead, because Demon Slayer is packed with beautiful artstyle. Needless to say, it was made by ufotable, so there is no need to go into the details.\nNow, sometimes, or sometimes too often, studios forget about the SEASONING (aka the sound). Or they simply do not have the budget for it, which is unfortunate, but not in this case. Hiro Shimono as Zenitsu does incredible job of being a wimpy crybaby, transitioning into the opposite. Saori Hayami manages to capture the sheer creepiness of her character. Obviously there are many more due to be listed here. Apart from the voice acting, similarly to the artstyle, there should not be any need to justify the glory of the soundtrack playing throughout the whole story.\n\nComing from someone who despises shounen shows, I seriously recommend everyone who stumbles upon this one to keep watching until the end. There are, of course, some convenient moments, where the plot armor shines brighter than the sun, but that can be forgiven this time given how much the positive things outweight this one little flaw. In the end, Demon Slayer proved to be one exceptionally tasty burger. Naturally it is imperative for the rest of the story to be released, but even so, it would be one of the better shows out there on its own; standalone, first season.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Akimono,"b""\n                Hello, today I will be talking about anime, which has won many awards. They deserved every one of those almost. \n\nPlease note that there will be a spoiler but I will notify you before, so you can just skip it if tou haven\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t  seen the animation yet.\n\nThe anime talks about demons and demon slayers in Taisho- era. It has visually pleasing fight scenes that you can literally watch an hour straight.  It also gives a pretty good insight into how life looked in japan during Taisho-era( 1912-1926). Kimetsu no Yaiba also greatly proteid beauty and the dark of a human soul, in my\n                  ...\n          opinion. \n\nIt really felt like they chose professionals for every department. The history side of anime was rather correct. It made me think that Ms. Koyoharu *(assuming that it was right also in the manga)* either has a historical background (either studied or is an enthusiast).  Movements in anime were on point. Fighting scenes didn\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t look dull thanks to that. The storyboard was played out nice even though you mostly watch fighting scenes, I didn't feel bored once.\n\nI read some other reviews and they said the content wasn't anything original. I at first thought the same but for me, I discovered something deeper from it. SPOILER AND TW!! - I cried already in the fifth episode. In the scene where Tanjiro was fighting the hand demon, I thought how the dead children represent the kids in real life who have lost to demons their lives. (mostly through horrible grownups but I also thought cancer and mental illnesses). But also the demon themselves were people who were wronged by society or had some kind of another tragic event in themselves and they didn't know to deal with it other than hurt others- therefore turning into demons. !! And like that the whole story took 360 turns for me. Yes, it was already used context but I feel like Ms. Koyoharu and the animation crew gave it whole new life.\n\nI loved the art style. It didn't look totally different, but it also didn't look like the regular style we see in most animes. Watching Kimetsu no yaiba I saw how similar water in fight scenes looked to the traditional way of portraying water in Japanese art. I felt like it added a nice touch to the historical theme. So I looked for references in other elements too, sadly other elements weren't pictured so traditionally. I also loved these patterns on their clothing!! so unique in my opinion.  One thing that I didn't like was the occasional 3D animations.  I'm just not a fan of 3D in anime.\n\nAs for characters, I don\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t agree with the best lead character award they got. I mean I loved Tanjiro, who didn't, right? The only problem is I couldn't see any minuses in his personality. He was a little perfect baby and sadly a mary sue. I haven't read the manga. Maybe there they open him up a little better but for now only minus, the main character was another Mary Sue. The same goes for Nezoko but I mean, she couldn't express herself much so I give her that.  For all other characters, you could clearly see their personality, they were all fun and had pretty human traits. I know some Zenitsus and I know some Inosukes. I wish I could have known more about some characters, but I guess that I have to read the manga, and it's hard to come up with so many sad stories. Also, I have to add, all the characters were really pretty.  >///<\n\nBut overall I really enjoyed it. I loved how I could add my own depth to it, think along. I will surely watch this anime again and again and I recommend it to ya all. \n\npoints- 9.6\n              """,Demon Slayer
Venom0723,"b'\n                Listen. Do NOT listen to the hate people have about this show. It became extremely mainstream and thus it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s super edgelord and hipster to hate on it unfairly. It definitely is not everyone\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s cup of tea I shall admit but there is a lot that it does right. I personally adore this show, but I will give it a fair assessment for anyone who reads this. \n\nStory: To me this is the one area where I feel complaints are valid. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s definitely set up in the shounen structure. Kid has tragedy, becomes strong  and trains to beat ultimate bad guy. The breadth of depth\n                  ...\n          to this show does get lost. This goes mostly into character development, which I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll touch later, and is vastly misunderstood and underrated imo. \n\nThe story is part historical, and part fantasy obviously. It feels a bit like the chimera ant arc in HxH meets Rurouni Kenshin. Not quite but that will give you a general gist of it. The sword fighting techniques used against the demons and their powers feel different to each and every character and gives some depth to battle, and really employs strategy not found as often in this genre. There is some good world building and hidden plot threads to chew through once more seasons come. If you can handle shounen and like sword fighting and not crazy like blasts, and some slow pacing at the beginning, then you will enjoy this show. \n\nSound: fantastic OST. This is personal preference but honestly the intro and most of the sound overall is pretty well done. The intro always got me pumped and the voice acting in the sub was fantastic. \n\nArt: does this even need to be stated? Have you seen fate/stay? It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s unfotable. They are God\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s among men with their animation quality and both the battle scene that had this show trending worldwide and the last episode especially stood out. \n\nCharacters: This is the part I hate criticized the most.  Zenitsu, thunder wimp, whatever you want to call him gets especially hated on. For the anime only people, they see the character as a total pain to listen to. They actually seem to hate him, but all his bad qualities are there to show his development which is to come in the story further down the road.  Same with the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93pig headed\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd inosuke (pun intended). Best girl Nezuko clearly has character growth throughout the first season even if she does play second fiddle to the MC. The hashiras all have individual personalities which haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t been explored yet, but most of the supporting cast really gets some TLC to have growth, even if there wasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t enough time to do so in season one. A lot of the demons get fleshed out back stories. Although considering the time of these flashbacks a brief amount of character growth is obtained but clearly they are still demons who have murderer and consumed humans \n\nLet\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s get to the real meat and potatoes. Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s talk MC. A lot of complaints and I say they are a little warranted is the lack of growth for the MC. This is not at all true. After his family is attacked, killed and turned into demons which kicks off this story he is steadily improving. A weak child unable to protect and now vowing to do whatever to save his sister. His growth is in that department and a bit less emotional. This is not a bad thing at all. Let me explain. \n\nOur MC Tanjiro is pretty different from most shounen characters. He doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t like to fight. He doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t believe in a magic power of friendship. He simply is doing what he must to protect his sister. He fights for his sister and his love for her and his family takes root. This leads to growth between their dynamic and leads to both of them getting tougher mentally and physically. That said there are characteristics of Tanjiro that is so vastly different from other characters, specially in this show. Tanjiro is not afraid to strike and demon down. He is however gentle as a breeze. He is calming and soothing and feels pity and sorrow for the horror a lot of the demons went through to get there. He is kind and nice and isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t your over the top white knight, even if he is constantly seen helping. He is just gentle and is unswaying in his personality. So much of his growth is set to be physically improving, learning the secrets of his father, and growing his bonds with his sisters and friends so he has motivation to work harder. He really has some shining moments coming even if currently they haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t aired much of his personal growth in season 1. \n\nConclusion: I cannot convince you to like the story or setting. Some people don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t like shounen and don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t like fantasy action. After reading the manga to current I can honestly say I loved the story, for the story. I enjoyed the character development and the seriousness of the manga. If you watch shounen and can handle the story then just know everything else is pretty much too their. The animation, and the sound are among the best there is and I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t thing anyone can straight faced disagree with that. If character growth is super important to you, than at least watch the movie and or season 2 whenever it comes out before you write off the characters. This is an enjoyable show and regardless of how much people hype it up over \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93influencers\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd tweeting about it, or the people hating it for the sole purpose of it being too mainstream or the fact that it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s too popular, I will say plain and simple it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s great. Unless unfotable screws it up ( yeah right) this will almost certainly be a classic, this will land on the top shounen of all time list once it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s said and done. There is too much to love about this show and personally I cannot wait to see things really kick off in the coming seasons.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Potatobanana,"b""\n                What do you get by bringing together gorgeous visuals, a majestic soundtrack and talented voice actors to animate a relatively good but not too excellent manga? A shockingly masterpiece of an anime is what you get.\n\nI initially decided to pick up Demon Slayer due to the sheer hype, I initially started with the manga (which was good in my eyes but not really a record breaking series) until I picked up the anime, which really brought the intriguing story to life and truly making the watch a very memorable one\n\nThe story of Demon Slayer is relatively straightforward, with a few obstacles blocking Tanjiro's way to\n                  ...\n          achieving this. Although unfortunately, the series may be guilty of utilizing plot convenience at times. However, the plot is definitely quite mesmerizing and a relatively unique one at that with the historical elements of the series really being brought out in a good light and the stakes and intensity really remain high at every episode to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe art in the manga was absolutely gorgeous but made the fight scenes and breathing techniques seem extremely underwhelming. Ufotable has certainly outdone themselves with how absolutely stunning they made the fight scenes look, You can quite literally pause an episode at any given moment and make it a wallpaper with how stunning most of the visuals are, with a perfect balance of CG and regular 2D animation. The camera angles of some scenes are especially exquisite, it made some scenes that were otherwise quite normal in the manga seem extremely epic in the anime, whether it be fight scenes or certain character reveal scenes. The setting is just breathtaking, literally the first minute in the snowy plains was just a hint of what was to follow.\n\nThe soundtrack of Demon Slayer is incredible in its own right, massive props to the sound production team. The anime has its fair share of emotional or epic scenes greatly amplified due to the well made and well timed soundtrack, and I doubt any complains can be made about it. The VFX of the anime meets expectations, though does not exceed them either, with the setting having very realistic background audio and certain attacks having well chosen sounds to give a realistic yet fantasy feel to it\n\nThe characters, in manga form, were quite average in my eyes with Zenitsu in particular quite lacking, especially in the comedy aspect. But the Anime certainly obliterated these weaknesses, The incredible voice acting really helped express the emotions of certain characters in emotional scenes while successfully creating humor for comedic scenes. Tanjiro's personality of being an extremely kind, caring and selfless person yet ruthless and overly emotional at times is a very interesting character I hope to see developed even further in the coming seasons just as the manga had. I personally enjoy the innocent sibling love that is a prominent element of the series rather than some forced romantic relationship that seems to plague many other shonen series in the present. Even characters such as Zenitsu and Inosuke received minor developments by the end despite appearing in about half the season. Not to mention the introduction of the Hashira is a great set up for future character development as well.\n\nAlso worth noting is how incredibly fleshed out many of the villains are, it truly portrays how most demons are just victims of temptation rather than catalysts of death and evil. Which truly makes you respect Tanjiro's character for truly empathizing with them despite having suffered so much from them.\n\nIn conclusion, Demon Slayer is certainly a series worth picking up and the anime has done a splendid job in not only honoring the manga but even exceeding it in various aspects. One of the best recent series that Shonen Jump has been blessed by and I truly hope Ufotable can do as splendid a job in adapting the last few arcs (or even exceeding the manga again) just as they have done during this season\n              """,Demon Slayer
oneyedkingdes,"b""\n                This anime is a freaking masterpiece.\n\nHonestly,the art style, the fluidity of combat is AMAZING! How they show the lightning style, water style and others is so cool. The story is the same as other anime of this category where humanity's survival is threatened and the mc joins a force to bring peace or some other motive.\n\nIts got a decent story with great art and fluid motions and some fair comedy.The combat parts is something to look forward to. It's really great.\n\nIt's got some some cute moments and dark moments too. The main character isn't like others that you see who go on killing the other\n                  ...\n          creatures with no sympathy or no feelings or quick death or some painful way. But here the main character realizes how they feel, understands their past life, the stuff they went through and kills in a almost a painless way even if it is with a sword. Not like quick death or something but in a way where the bad guys or the demons kind of die happily or are at their happiest moment. I know this must be sounding crazy but I don't have any other way to say this. It's like knowing what the other person has went through and relieving them of their suffering in a beautiful way(I DONT MEAN KILLING'S BEAUTIFUL BUT THE WAY THE MC DOES IT THE DEMONS ARE AT THEIR HAPPIEST AND MOST PEACEFUL TIME) even though he is just killing them.\nYou'll get what I am trying to say after you watch it.\n\nIT'S WORTH IT AND BESIDES YOU GET TO SEE NEZUKO, what more do you want?\n              """,Demon Slayer

TheEternalHunter,"b'\n                What can I say about this anime ...? This is a masterpiece for me. It has brilliant graphics, but as we all know, it doesn\'t matter that much. They\'re just so good I can\'t help but mention them.\n\nThe story is very intriguing. From the very beginning, the anime starts hard. You see how the main character, Kamado Tanjirou, leaves his family for a short period of time and when he returns they are all killed by a demon without a single member. This member is not just anyone, but his little sister Kamado Nezuko, who, to Tanjirou\'s great misfortune, has become a demon and is\n                  ...\n          trying to kill him. As they fight, a seemingly unimportant character appears, Tomioka Giyuu, who saves Tanjirou and thinks it\'s right to kill the demon his little sister has become, but despite the scene from before, Tanjirou is against it and defends her little sister at the cost of his life. This dramatic moment awakens Nezuko\'s soul and she also intercedes for her brother. Tomioka Giyuu decides to believe the words of the two young people and sends them to Urokodaki Sakonji, who trains the young Tajirou in the basics so that he can pass the test for joining the ranks of Demon Slayers. You will probably wonder why he does it? He does this so that he can find a way to get his sister back in human form. There is no point in explaining what happens next, because I should have already won your attention, or rather you should have already played the first episode, but let me finish.\n\n Remember when I told you that Tomioka Giyuu seems minor at first glance? Well ... He later became one of my favorite characters in this anime.You will see why when you watch it. Tanjirou and Nezuko go through many difficulties together. Nezuko even has to pass a relentless test to prove that she is different from other demons. Anime has its own style. One of the few animes that made me really smile as I watched, thanks to Agatsuma Zenitsu. Anyway, so far with the anime episodes. \n\nIt\'s really worth watching and I recommend it with both hands up. It even ends in a very promising way, and by ""promising"" I mean it promises Season 2. After a little research I did, I saw how long the manga lasted, so there\'s enough material for Season 3, even Season 4. There\'s only one thing I don\'t like and it has nothing to do with the anime itself. I\'m annoyed that the reviews at the top aren\'t that good. They explain the anime as simple and straightforward. that there\'s nothing deep in it, even though these are only the first 26 episodes.Wait for the next seasons to release and you\'ll get the depth you want.\n              '",Demon Slayer

RPWPA,"b""\n                Kimetsu No Yaiba is a masterpiece in the making, it doesn't have the best or most original story but it has the capability of going the unpredictable way when faced with cliches, it has creative writing, art, animation and a great set of characters that help it achieve much more than most action/drama anime which is why it became as popular as it is now. \n\nWhat makes the anime stand out are the good characters as well as the animation/art. The animation/art part is predictable though, I mean it is Ufotable after all so I never expect any lazy parts in that part but let's\n                  ...\n          talk some more about the characters. \n\nThe characters are amazing, Tanjiro who I think is a main character done right, he isn't an angry edgy teen or a coward of an MC, he is a calm MC that doesn't have superpowers yet he is so mindful that he tries to use whatever he has to become a stronger person, he didn't let the hate consume him and make him think that all demons are like that because they like it, they too feel the pain and suffering and some of them were forced into it because they don't know any better. Of course best girl Nezuko is a very big reason for that, she is also a very good kind and caring character. Those 2 made the anime much better, they created a wonderful atmosphere with familial love and caring for eachother and that was enough to make them great. \nI also loved the fact that even the villians had great backstories, it shows the pain they felt and how they were forced into turning into a demon. They fear and feel hatred and sadness which shows that despite turning, they still have somewhat a human side to them, this is also one of the best parts that showed how good they were as well as how great of a character Tanjiro is to understand that and grant them peacefull death instead of suffering. This is a spoiler so SPOILER WARNING IN THE NEXT SENTENCE but the death of the spider queen was by far the best one. It showed how the mindeset of Tanjrio changes once he gains knowledge of anything and how just feeling that a character has been through stuff makes him think of his choices. \n\nAll the other characters are great, from his friends to the other side characters and villians, they were all great and had unique characteristics. \n\nThe voice acting was great so 10/10 as well as the OSTs/OP/ED songs. \n\nOverall I would give thie anime a 9/10. This anime has been extremely fun and enjoyable, this should be enough for me to give it a high score tbh. \nWould recommend it to anyone tbh.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Alesko,"b""\n                I didn't mean to watch this anime, since it came out last year and I already had a long list of titles to check out... But then I kept on hearing people mention it and I saw some youtube clips. I felt hyped to it was the perfect time to watch it and actually finish it. And, what can I say, that was the right choice. Recently I even finished the manga, so I have some room to compare. \n\nMain reason for my high rating is... there's nothing really I disliked. There were a lot of things I loved, that's for sure. The genre and\n                  ...\n          themes are all in line with what I like and search for in what I watch, but I was quite surprised when I finished watching and realized that I can't really point anything out. If I thought really hard about it, there could be some minor details, maybe. But when I was watching and after, nothing bothered me. When I think about Demon Slayer I only have good feelings and memories, so I'm grateful for that.\n\nFirst of all, the art style and animation is obviously amazing. I noticed CGI at a few instances, but it wasn't that bad. But CGI is CGI, it still catches your eye and looks out of place if you notice that it's there. Other than that, the animation is top notch, especially in the fight scenes, where they use their special moves. A lot of vibrant colors, be it blue Water Style or red Dance of the Fire God or even yellow Thunder... The fluid and energetic movements... It really feels like everything from the manga came to life. Not only the fight scenes. Obviously, you can't properly express characters like Zenitsu or Inosuke on paper. When you hear Zenitsu's ridiculous screams and see Inosuke slamming his head into a tree like a maniac, it's just great.\n\nI can actually remember some of the soundtrack which is strange, since I usually don't. Maybe it's because those are good songs, maybe because they really fit in the moment... Well, I can say the music is good.\n\nMy favourite part is the overall plot/characters/relationships/worldbuilding. Nezuko and Tanjiro are just such an amazing duo. Nezuko's special circumstances and cuteness make her really lovable. She saves the day multiple times and just by her defiant existance is bound to help much more, even though some people don't accept her. Zenitsu is very annoying at the beginning, but then you get used to him and see that he's a good person and can actually fight sometimes. Same with Inosuke, at first annoying with his desire to always fight but also funny and you get used to him. The backstory is quite interesting, with one person being the original demon who can turn others, or with the Demon Slayers who aren't recognized by law and not everyone knows that demons exist unless they meet them themselves. I liked how surprised Tanjiro was, seeing a big city for the first time, living his whole life in mountains. Some people make coal as their job, some people fight demons with their swords, some people ride trains. It's different everywhere. \n\ntldr; yes\n              """,Demon Slayer
Shingster,"b""\n                Please be advised that this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Kimetsu no Yaiba and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \n\nBased off a popular manga of the same name Kimetsu No Yaiba which is better known by its English title of Demon Slayer or alternatively as Demon slaying blade is a adventure, dark fantasy genre anime that gives us a rather unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day a hardworking teenage boy who after the early departure of his\n                  ...\n          father and taking up the hard task of supporting his family as the lone man in the house was to after a delayed return to his home were to not only stumble across the slaughtered remains of his family but also discover to his horror that his beloved younger sibling Nezuko had rather than perish with her family as humans had in fact been infected and transformed into a demon that saw anyone, not of her kind as an enemy. After barely managing to stave off his now demonfied sister while at the same time managing to convince a newly arrived demon slayer from slaying his sister Tanjirou now the  sole human left from his family must now after receiving much-needed guidance from Tomioka the demon slayer embark on a difficult and potentially lethal journey as he sets about joining the one organisation among the world that can potentially hold the cure that can revert his sister back to human form the Demon slaying corps. Though the path will be a fearsomely difficult one for Tanjirou the strong desire to make his beloved sister human again means that no matter who or what stands in his way he will fight to his utmost to protect his sister and his friends while striving to find the one thing that will make his sister human again. While adventure genre animes that feature hero\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s that embark on a difficult quest in order to save either their village or their loved ones from harm are a standard feature for Shonen anime what can be said to draw me to Kimetsu no Yaiba was the unique premise that led to Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s journey as well as the nature of the war that Tanjirou will be walking into as he sets about joining the Demon slaying corps both of which I felt complimented each other perfectly. The first episode of the series I felt served to prove this preconception of mine as while it did well in introducing both the setting and the tragic circumstances that eventually led to the embarkation of Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s journey it also featured the strong blends of tension, revelation, and action that I expected from anime made by Unfotable all of which served to make the first episode a very strong one and convinced me to watch the series to the end. \n\nThe overall story of the series follows the life of Tanjirou Kamado a kind and intelligent teenage boy who until the start of the series lived with the rest of his family in a land that is reminiscent of  Taisho era Japan a time of great change both in terms of society and in terms of advancement both in terms of technology and in the reveal of supernatural monsters that were once thought off as nothing more than myths. In a land that is filled with rapidly changing events and tech and unknown to all but the highest levels of government a secret but fierce battle one where there are no obvious battle lines is being waged between the highly trained and fierce members of the Demon slaying Corps the Kisatsutai and the mysterious but equally monstrous demons that have started to emerge from the shadows of the world as if drawn to the advancement that humanity has made in the recent years. Whether in remote villages or in the newest cities that have taken advantage of the tech advancement to spring up and bring progress to its population this seemingly secret war will leave its mark be it in the form of blood splattered walls of a lone alleyway or in the rash of mysterious disappearances of a host of young woman that leave not even a bone behind. But for the members of the corps though every death that they are unable to save is another source of regret for them it also ensures that they will pay the demons back in death ten times to the amount of suffering that they have inflicted on their victims and ensuring that in this war mercy is a word that doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t exist on either side. Into this maelstrom of fierce battles against monstrous and cunning foes Tanjirou must not only use his intelligence and wits but also all of his skills if he ever hopes to not only save his sister but also face the one demon that was responsible for turning his sister Muzan Kibutsuji but before that Tanjirou must not only survive his training but also get strong enough to be acknowledged by his seniors. Only then will he have the strength to achieve his goals. \n\nTanjirou Kamado \n\nTanjirou Kamado portrayed by veteran voice actor Natsuki Hanae of Aldnoah Zero and Fate /Apocrypha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A teenage boy that until the beginning of the crisis that ultimately started his journey was only worried about supporting his cherished family and support them through diligence at selling his local wares at nearby towns Tanjirou on initial impressions is shown to be a kind, responsible and hardworking person and was seen to be a person that was both gentle and considerate to a fault always striving to help others and never turning down requests for assistance no matter the favor being asked. An honest, positive and friendly person by nature Tanjirou was shown to be someone that believes strongly in fairness and in repaying the debts that he owes to others a fact that served to ensure that both he and his family were held in high regard by their neighbours. To Tanjirou, in the beginning, being able to both support his neighbours while also doing what he can to support the well being of his family can be said to be everything that he wished for in life which is shown in the interactions that he has with both. However to Tanjirou, this seemingly perfect life was to come to an abrupt end one morning as he returned to find not the heartwarming welcome that he expected from his mother and his siblings but instead find to his shock and horror that all but his younger sister had been slain. With the loss of not just his beloved family but also of the strong emotional ties that linked them together Tanjirou in the aftermath was said to be almost broken both mentally and physically prevented only from giving in to despair by the revelation that his younger sister Nezuko had managed to survive the bloodbath that had claimed everyone else. However, this soon transformed into a bittersweet moment for though she had survived Nezuko had also suffered a fate perhaps worse than death for she had been transformed into the same type of being that had served to destroy the one link that both Tanjirou and she had enjoyed together which was their family. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Tanjirou was forced to accept the cruel reality of the fact that not only was much of his family dead but his lone surviving relative his sister Nezuko had also been transformed into the same beings that had committed the act. Though grief-stricken beyond words Tanjirou rather than give into despair as many would have instead did what many would have thought impossible for a boy his age transforming his grief and sadness from a myriad of negative energy into a potent source of motivation to achieve his new life goal in this harsh new reality that he finds himself in which is to not only find the being responsible for the tragedy that had befallen his family but also, more importantly, find a means to turn Nezuko human again. A goal that soon came to head when Tanjirou was introduced to the shadowy but elite Demon slayers corps that hunts the very beings that he seeks revenge on in dramatic fashion. Though barely managing to stop the corps from killing his sister Tanjirou was soon confronted with not just the sheer magnitude of the path that he had set upon both in terms of finding the demon responsible and in gaining the required strength that he needs to order to achieve his goal a goal that he soon found an answer for in the form of joining the corps as a slayer. \n\nAs the series progresses and Tanjirou comes to understand the harsh realities that the corps puts through to train its personal Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s personality gradually starts to change. While largely retaining his kind, gentle and friendly personality Tanjirou is shown to show a great deal of determination both in his quest to overcome his training and also in his desire to achieve his main quest. While the training itself was a tough one it can be seen that Tanjirou rather let the training beat him instead sought to adapt himself to the training so as to allow him to not only gain new skills but also ones that will serve to overcome his inherent flaws of which there were many. While shown to be somewhat slow, indecisive and poor at reading situations in the beginning Tanjirou as the series goes on gradually begins to change becoming more perceptive both in terms of discerning physical expressions and in physical smells and becoming more willing to act on hunches that he senses a skill that gradually allows him to not just make quick but also decisive decisions on the field and in the process allowing him to easily adapt to the fast-changing battlefield. This development both in terms of attitude and skill can best be shown in the way in which Tanjirou handles his missions after becoming a slayer. Rather than give into despair that many of his contemporaries will when confronted with a threat that they cannot overcome Tanjirou will instead seek to adapt his attacks so as to both take advantage of an enemies flaw while also to learn from the mistake that he had made previously a skill that takes great advantage of both his perceptive nature and his desire to learn all he can from his foes and get stronger. However even as a member of the corps it can be seen that Tanjirou has never lost sight of his core values of wanting to help innocents and indeed even as a slayer he still tries hard to help every person that he can in his travels no matter the urgency of his missions or the risks associated with rescuing ones that are located in dangerous terrain. This desire to help all that he can no matter the risks while itself a base trait of Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s can also be said to be a development that came from seeing his family butchered as to Tanjirou being able to reunite loved ones, reunite families or allow a grieving fianc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9e closure by killing the demons responsible for their pain is a small victory in Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s eyes. \n\nAs a member of the corps which when combined with his own personal quest its certainly understandable that Tanjirou was someone that can be said to view demons as his sworn enemies but this can be said to be only half true. While Tanjirou himself does indeed bear demonkind with all due hatred he unlike his fellows within the corps was also shown to be able to differentiate between those demons that mean harm to humans and those that bear no ill will towards them. While influenced to a degree by his gentle and friendly nature this desire to converse with peaceful demons and listen to their side of things can be said to be a development that came about as a result of Nezuko\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s transformation into a being that while possessing the strength and resilience of demon had also learned to view humans as allies rather than as food. While itself a punishable offence this act of being able to work with like-minded demons shows that while Tanjirou aspires to become strong and attain the strength that he needed in order to find the one responsible for his pain that he has lost none of the qualities that have made him such an endearing person a development that few within the corps are shown to have a development that I felt suited Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s desire to become strong while still holding the values and qualities that determine who he was before the tragedy.  \n\nNezuko \n\nNezuko Kamado portrayed by veteran seiyuu Akari Kitou of Classroom of the Elite fame is one of the main characters of the series and is Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s younger sister. Before the tragedy that enveloped their family and wrought a cruel fate to her Nezuko was seen to be a kind, caring and friendly girl who though not being able to leave her house to make money in town did all she can to support her mother and her siblings in the absence of a man in the house. However though Nezuko worked hard to support her family and ensure that their life while not one of wealth was most definitely one that ensured that her family was able to survive and eke out a living in relative comfort all of this changed one fateful night when they were attacked by a demon that tragically killed all but herself and her brother Tanjirou. Despite Nezuko\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s best attempts to protect her siblings, her efforts were ultimately in vain. However while it was a small comfort that Nezuko did not perish with the rest of her family it can be said her survival while certainly a fortunate one was also one that was overshadowed by the fact that Nezuko was no longer human for she had been transformed into the very beings that wiped out her beloved family a fate that was perhaps worse than death for her. \n\nAfter her transformation into a demon Nezuko\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s personality changes dramatically. While the transformation into a demon served to take away much of her humanity by way of taking away her ability to speak and show physical expressions that would have added charm to her human self the transformation itself also gave her what can be said to be a form of poetic revenge for Nezuko in her new form was not only able to wield massive strength but also use this to fight against demons and slayers on even if not on skilled terms. However despite the gaining of such strength it can be seen that Nezuko despite not being able to express it as easily feels immense regret and anger with the former due to the fact that she was unable to protect her family from their fate and the latter that she had not only survived but done so in a new form that only served to inconvenience her brother effects that served to impart within Nezuko a sense a frustration in the beginnings of her travels with Tanjirou. In the immediate aftermath of her awakening due largely to the demon blood that was now running through her veins Nezuko was shown to have developed a rather short temper and was shown to display  instances of aggression and anger towards others quite easily a fact that it made it difficult for Tanjirou to transport her in the first days. However as the series goes on and Nezuko through the travels that she experiences  with Tanjirou and the teachings that she learns from the people that they encounter along the way gradually begins to master these sudden urges of her and manages to develop the ability to not only restrain them but also use them at the most opportune moment. Despite being transformed into a demon it can be seen that Nezuko\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s transformation itself while certainly giving her the strength of a demon had not entirely transformed her psyche to match it and indeed apart from the aggression that she displayed early in her transformation she unlike other demons did not see humans as food a fact that was used effectively by Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s mentor during his training to not only lessen the burden that Tanjirou would have that will potentially affect his progress but also prove to the world that perhaps not all demons are enemies after all. \n\nAs a result of this while still retaining the strength and aggression that defined her new form Nezuko also managed to in the process regain some element of her humanity. Instead of seeing humans as potential foes as she had previously Nezuko now saw them as something that was akin to family that was to be protected at all costs. While ensuring that Nezuko now saw humans as people that she had to protect this also served to reintroduce a number of personality traits that had existed within Nezuko previously that served to enhance her newfound personality with these being loyalty, protectiveness and a determination to do all she can to protect her charges traits that when used in conjunction with the bitter memories of her family only served to ensure that she will fight to the last to protect others. However while developing this new sense of protectiveness towards others it can be seen that this also served to introduce secondary elements into Nezuko in that while remaining protective and loyal towards her new duty Nezuko also displays a curious and somewhat playful nature towards her interaction towards others as shown humorously in her interactions with Lady Tamayo and her charge when she and Tanjirou encountered her. These secondary elements when used in conjunction with her other developmental traits I felt served to expand Nezuko\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s character relatively well as while it gave Nezuko the ability to exact revenge on the demons by using her newfound strength to not only deny them their victory but also use it to protect the very innocents that she had been expected to kill to survive it also allowed Nezuko to be seen in a more positive light by others which when used in conjunction with the fact that few see demons as nothing more than monsters is something that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s notable both in terms of story advancement as well as in lore advancement. \n\nGiyuu Tomioka \n\nGiyuu Tomioka portrayed by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Anohana and Active Raid fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s allies within the series. A veteran demon slayer of the Demon slaying corps and a member of the corps elite Pillars group the corps nine most powerful swordsmen to which he serves as the Water Pillar. On initial expressions, Giyuu is shown to be a quiet, calm, collected and honest person by nature that was dutiful and unflinching in his duties. While a quiet and somewhat blunt person that showed few emotions Giyuu was someone that was shown to have a strong sense of justice and responsibility and indeed saw it as his sacred duty to come to the aid of innocents that were being menaced by demons to save them as fast as he can. As a result of this attitude, Giyuu was shown to be visibly devastated when he found that he was too late Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s family. However, what served to perplex him the most was the fact that though a demon was present in the area instead of running in fear as most humans do upon seeing one Tanjirou was instead trying desperately to protect her something that not even a veteran like him had ever witnessed. \n\nLike much of the corps Giyuu was seen to view demons as nothing more than a menace and a constant scourge to the innocents that are caught in their sights and as a result was seen to view Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s attempts to defend it as nothing more than idiocy a fact that he made plainly to Tanjirou during his first encounter with both him and Nezuko. However as a result of both seeing Tanjirou try so desperately to protect the demon as well of Nezuko work so hard to restrain herself this served to make him for the first time in his career halt his blade. Though seen to be someone that viewed demons with nothing but hatred Giyuu was also shown to be someone that was surprisingly open-minded if only reluctantly. While loaf to let a single demon escape his blade it can be  seen and inferred that like most veterans among the corps Giyuu too was someone that had grown weary of seeing many of his comrades perish on the claws of the demons that they had been fighting for years and as a result though wary of breaking corp laws was willing to at least test out a possibility that no matter how small can prove useful for future generations of slayers a belief that will soon prove beneficial to the corps as Tanjirou not only managed to survive the training that had been obtained at Giyuu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s express wishes but also in the process prove that not all demons were enemies and that perhaps there will be a time when peace between humans and demons will indeed be possible. The character of Giyuu I felt was an interesting character in that while he didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t exhibit any notable physical changes much of the change within his character actually takes place within his perception and opinion of demons. As a veteran of the corps and one of the elite Pillars that form the cornerstone of it it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a given that Giyuu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s service with them had been a long one that was full of not just fierce battles that saw impressive triumphs that saved hundreds but also many tragic defeats that cost the corp dearly in lives for both comrades and civilians alike. In this black and white world where death is ever-present while it's easy to lose hope its equally easy to just see every demon as an enemy to be cut down without realising the larger picture. In this I felt that having Giyuu a veteran slayer make the call that has so much potential for change was an excellent development as while not affecting the present situation the potential that the bud that he helped nurture can serve to have a notable effect on the future an observation that was as the series progressed aptly demonstrated. \n\nShinobu Kochou \n\nShinobu Kochou portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of The Irregular at Magic high school and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s allies within the series. A veteran demon slayer and a member of the Pillars in which she serves as the Insect Pillar Shinobu on initial impressions is shown to be a positive, caring and calm person by nature that exhibited a friendly and polite attitude at all times and was someone that tried hard to bond with others no matter how quiet and blunt they were. Indeed Shinobu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s attitude can also be seen to be a mismatch if one did not know the role that she plays within the corps or the rank that she has then one can easily mistake her for being a normal girl in this age. While a positive person and someone that genuinely enjoys teasing people Shinobu was also someone that was also capable of being serious and in this phase she was shown to be a confident, perceptive and fast thinking person that had a preference for using skilled tactics, perception and patience as much as sword skills when engaged in combat a strategy that can be seen to take great advantage of her role as being the Pillar that makes equal use of poison and healing to both hinder her enemies as well as heal her allies. \n\nAs the series goes on and Shinobu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that despite her positive and friendly nature that she like every other slayer within the corps is someone that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s been through pain as well. While Shinobu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s default friendly and caring self can be said to be her true personality it can be seen that this is only half true for while she cares deeply about the lives and well being of her allies and friends Shinobu is someone that prefers to hide her own feelings behind the masks that she creates for while Shinobu was noted to be a powerful swordswoman that when paired with both her experience and her ability as a healer made her even more so she was also noted to be someone that was particularly adept at the use of psychological warfare as shown in the countless battles in which she seemingly gives the impression that there exists a way for a demon to escape only to close it shut when the time comes. This combination of her somewhat sadistic attitude towards demons and her speciality as a combat healer that specialises in the use of poison to disorient and slowly take out demons served to create within Shinobu one hell of an alt personality one that made her an absolute terror to the demons that she faced. While shown to bear the demons with the same level of hatred that most of her fellows do as the series goes on it can be seen that to her the demon was a far more of a personal matter to her as a family matter as it was to her as a professional matter for her beloved sister had perished at their hands as a result of both her desire for peace and an end to the centuries-old war that had existed in the land since ancient times. \n\nWhen combined with her own empathic nature as well as her natural kind and caring nature towards her friends and allies this can be seen to cause an inner turmoil of sorts within Shinobu. For while she views the demons that not only took her sister from her but also inflict so much suffering in the world with hatred that served as a potent source of motivation for her to go about her duties her own way she also finds it both difficult and perplexing to find out why her beloved sister would go so far as to lose her own life in order to realise a dream that sounds impossible no matter how you looked at it for to her demons were mere monsters that had to be put down a view that only intensified as the years go by and is only stopped when she encounters a young slayer named Tanjirou whose sincere and determined nature and wish to get stronger so as to get the cure that will free his beloved sister was one that Shinobu both understood and can relate to qualities that served for the first time since her sisters passing to reveal the fierce conflicts that she was struggling with beneath her mask one that may soon see salvation if change is indeed coming to the age-old war between the demon and the slayer. \n\nAMV \n\nIn terms of  both character designs as well as in environmental design and terrain variety I felt that the locations and settings that were featured within the series were not just beautiful but also well thought out while also taking excellent advantage of the foundation of the time period being a close approximation of the Taisho era a time period that blended in emerging cities with the still largely rural villages and towns that dotted the country. The effects of such a fine balance between modern cities and rural areas was seen well in the different types of operating areas in which Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s missions sent him to notable examples being the demon forest and the town that served as the AO for Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s first mission.  In terms of character designs, I felt that the individual characters featured within the series whether main ones, support ones or even bystanders were excellent showing not just excellent attention to detail but also variety as well with the members of the Demon slayer corps being the notable examples. With regards to the demon designs I felt that while the great majority of the demons were beast-like there were also a number of demons that looked human like which while allowing them the ability to blend into society also afforded them the ability to feed on a unsuspecting population as well a fact that did well to illustrate that  while society was advancing at breakneck speed that beneath society a secret war was being waged and that demons can literally be anyone. While affording them a degree of mystique I also felt that this also served to differentiate the demons as within the series the ones that resemble humans were shown to be the ones that were the more powerful ones that could call upon a greater variety of skills when they engage with notable examples here being the spider demon family. Combat animations wise I felt that the combat within the series is a definite highlight of the series due to the combination of fluid combat animations with the sword effects and Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s thread seeing aspect being notable examples and the well designed and executed battles that combined both the inherent tension that came from fighting powerful enemies and the fact that you were fighting against something that can potentially call upon hundreds of abilities that can skewer you if you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re careless. While the battles were certainly beautiful to look at I felt that they also made great use of both Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s developing skills as a slayer both physically and mentally and the inherent abilities that his opponents made use of to give us many excellent battles where the stakes were extremely high with notable examples being the fight against Muzan\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s lackeys and the fight within the demon forest. While combat animation was extremely strong I also felt that the series also managed to use the strong animation to enhance this via the creative use of patterns and visual representation of Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s senses with the former being seen in his attacks and the latter in his keen sense of smell both of which served to enhance Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s ability to deal with emerging threats. \n\nIn terms of music the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Gurenge for the former and from the edge that was both performed by veteran singer LISA both while excellent songs served to induce within me a different set of emotions with the former introducing a sense of loss, tension and a strong desire to go up against the odds and achieve a strong goal while the latter was a calmer one that gave the impression of happier and more peaceful times that I felt alluded to the life that Tanjirou had before the demons struck. The series OST I felt was one that was not only well designed but also one that featured a surprising variety that allowed it to complement the various scenes and emotions shown within the series relatively well varying between dramatic ones for the battles and calming and peaceful ones for the training arc and the off-time between the battles where Tanjirou was bonding with his comrades. Voice acting-wise I felt that the series main and support cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I feel that Natsuki Hanae, Saori Hayami, Takahiro Sakurai all did an excellent job at portraying the main characters of Tanjirou, Shinobu and Giyuu respectively with Saori Hayami in particular deserving of special praise on account of her brilliant portrayal of Shinobu. With the regards to the support cast I felt that Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Ai Kakuma, Maaya Sakamoto, Houchuu Ootsuka, Ami Koshimizu, Yuri Ehara and Ryouko Shiraishi all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Inosuke, Makomo, Lady Tamayo, Sakonji, Mother spider demon, Aoi Kanzaki and the older sister spider demon respectively. \n\nOverall conclusion \n\nIn overall Kimetsu no Yaiba I felt was an excellent anime that was undoubtedly one of this years best with its main strong points, in my opinion, being its unique premise, strong and well thought out story that weaved together breathtaking action with excellent lore, excellent characters that were both unique and well developed, Well designed and developed battles that took great advantage of both the beautiful combat animations and the large amount of demon abilities that were seen within the series, excellent voice acting from a talented voice cast and a gradual expansion of the history and circumstance of both sides as Tanjirou enters that fabled world. \n\nThe overall story of the series can be said to be one of the series main strong points and in my opinion, was one of the main things that served to draw me to this series. While the idea of a protagonist electing to embark on a journey that would allow him to get stronger is the staple of shonen manga I felt that in this case the story actually paired well with its unique and shocking premise as while Tanjirou was indeed embarking on a journey to get stronger he was doing so for a far more personal reason than gaining strength for first and foremost he was doing so in order to find a cure for his sister and revert her back to human form. In this way, it can be said that the journey to becoming stronger was only a convenient method so as to achieve this goal. The overall goal of Tanjirou though certainly a seemingly impossible one and one that was fraught with peril I felt were paired relatively well with the overall story through its use of both the inherent bonds and chemistry that exists between Tanjirou and Nezuko as well as Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s visualisation of what an actual family should be like. While these served to create within Tanjirou a potent source of motivation I felt that this also served to allow him to see the war between the demon and the slayers in a new light as unlike Giyuu and Shinobu who as members of the Pillars had been fighting the war for years and had seen countless comrades cut down in the line of duty and who viewed demons with nothing but disdain Tanjirou was different due to both his unique goal and his own view on what a family should be like. In this Tanjirou rather than view every demon that he encounters in his journey as a hostile that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s to be cut down immediately instead does the opposite preferring to instead listen and understand their side of the story first before making a decision. \n\nWhile combat itself is not always unavoidable I felt that this served to not only show Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s desire to avoid needless slaughter while also allowing each of the demons featured within the series to have much more of an impact on both him and the overall plot. This within the series is helped greatly by the fact that rather than being simply one dimensional characters as many Shonen manga like to portray their primary hostile characters the demons shown within the series were not just powerful ones but also ones that had unique personalities that not only made them a match for the slayers in terms of intelligence and cunning but also in physical might as well on account of the variety of abilities that they can call upon all of which served to make each encounter that Tanjirou has with them a thrilling experience as one can not tell easily if a demon is a hostile one that has problems like the spider demon family or benevolent ones like Lady Tamayo who have surprisingly human-like problems that are bothering them. While serving to add a degree of variety to the overall story I felt that this expansion of the demons also served to show that while demons and humans are different beings they are in fact very similar to each other on account of both the environments that they live in and the problems and struggles that they have to struggle within their lives matters that while the rank and file slayers will never comprehend that Tanjirou thanks to his unique origins will and in doing so making the story that much more interesting. \n\nHowever while Kimetsu no Yaiba was an excellent anime I felt that there were some elements that served to derail the otherwise stellar anime that it almost managed to achieve. One of the things that I disliked about the anime was the character of Zenitsu. On a character level, while having one that starts off as weak and cowardly and gradually developing him into a stronger character as the series progresses is the standard developmental method within animes, in this case, I felt that as a character he barely had any kind of development that eliminated this trait of his. And while admittedly his unconscious attacks on his foes were cool this was offset by the fact that his constant shouting and complaints were annoying at best and immersion breaking at worst something that shouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be within animes in the first place. In addition while Kimetsu no Yaiba\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s story was touted to be a tale that allowed Tanjirou and Nezuko to fight together as a team as they both get stronger I felt in actual practice only Tanjirou managed to gain this strength due to the training that he received from his seniors and fellow members of the corps while Nezuko within the series had a gradually diminishing amount of appearances within the series to the point where we often forget that she\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s even here. This I felt was a shame as shown in the fight that Tanjirou engaged in during his first mission as well as during the defence of lady Tamayo the team-up between the two can be devastatingly effective against their foes when used correctly. \n\nOverall I feel that as a final score that Kimetsu no Yaiba deserves a final score of 9/10 that while featuring an excellent premise, story, battles, animation, voice acting and a welcome insight into the struggles that both sides experience in the war was let down by a number of issues that serve to derail the overall experience.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Katecof,"b'\n                I\'m completely disappointed with this anime, at the beginning, it looks like a decent shonen with a protagonist who accounts with good motivation, but as the episodes passed, many problems start to appear, first, the art direction has issues, yeah, yeah, the character design and the animation on the action scenes are great, but at the moment they tried to create some certain scenes, their building was lame, many parts of the anime hardly had any kind of appropriate anticipation (like the moment when we find the dead body of Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s mother) and they only showed it... just like that, giving the ""factor shock"" sensation\n                  ...\n          that is always awful, and don\'t make me start with all the cliffhangers on this show.\n\nThe cast is mediocre, although some characters have a backstory, many others hardly show any personality trait, Nezuko is the cute little sister who just does cute things and sometimes, fights, Zenitsu is the bipolar coward who waits till the moment of a dire need to do anything useful, and Inosuke is a mad murderer who just wants to fight; the enemies showed a backstory, but this only appears till they died, resulting in wasted potential\n\nThe narrative suffers the problems of the average shonen, power-ups like the seal that allows seeing the arrows, or the moment when the protagonist results being capable to change the water style power to a fire style power, these things that came out of nowhere are the reason of why the anime plot-armors feels lame.\n\nAnd that\'s it, a big disappointment to me.\n              '",Demon Slayer

KillTheFuture42,"b'\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4s strong side is without a doubt the production value of Ufotable. It can shine with good music, fluid animations, decent artwork and nice character design. \n\nThe problems seem to lay just under the highly polished surface. Especially the story, worldbuilding and characters are sadly quite lacking. \nBefore i go in deeper in my reasoning i would like to make a comparison to make my problems with the series so far a bit more clear.\n\nKnY is basicly Claymore, just with the problems inverted. Instead of a focus on the character and world building, Kimetsu is showing of spectacle.\nBoth anime are about a child\n                  ...\n          that loses it\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4s family to dangerous humanoid monsters, joins a shadowy organisation, is given a special sword and is send to take out said monsters. The similarities don\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t stop there, but the rest isn\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t realy necassary for my comparisson.\nThe main reason i even make this comparision is that i can see how amazing  KnY could have been. \n\nI was wondering about the way this world, this organisation or even the skills work, why the characters even do what they do and so on. Are ghosts normal in this universe? Why does Tanjirou think he should spend over 6 month training in the mountains instead of searching a cure for his sister? Why did his scar change and why didn\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t anyone in universe reacted to it? How can it be that the people of the land don\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t believe in demons anymore, when our MC can\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t even make two steps without finding one? How can a demon slayer afford food, medicine or an inn if the organisation doesn\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t even pay them? Why would anyone even listen to them after reciving his/her special sword? How does the magic work? \nThese problems and questions aren\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4t present in Claymore and other anime like it and it is so disappointing for me to see such a good looking take on the historical dark fantasy setting, falling over problems that were already solved over a decade ago.\n\n\nIt is sadly not the masterpiece i was hoping for, but it\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4s entertaining enough for anyone who is solely looking for eye-candy and spectacle.\n              '",Demon Slayer
ShaneOmac27,"b'\n                Well, admittedly I actually struggled considerably even getting myself to watch this series. The impression I had was that of an overhyped, relatively generic shounen- devoid of the elegant nuance I usually seek from anime and manga. I was of course incorrect in that assessment and I believe that to be emblematic of how this community can sometimes spur people towards judging something on things it isn\'t attempting to even do. \n\nDemon Slayer is just a lot of fun. Though, its lighthearted tone fluttering throughout most moments never really got in the way of some timeless thematic representations of various aspects of the human condition\n                  ...\n          for me personally. It\'s all balanced super well. Grave situations/emotions gives way to outlandish comedy rather quickly and at times even takes place closely together- it just sort of always refreshingly worked for me. Koyoharu Gotouge (the mangaka) wisely included quite a few characters with experiences rife with elemental characteristics of different types of people and how events in life can affect them; I considerably enjoyed realizing the author understands many different types of people well enough to include so many believable characters and reactions from them. \n\nWhen one character says to another, ""I guess..the voice in your heart is really tiny"" or "" Hey, that doesn\'t matter. Since you helped me out, you\'re part of me now. And I\'m carrying all of your emotions onto the battlefield with me!"" surrounded by the context that makes those lines relevant, they serve as examples of how a writer can voluminously imbue authentic reminders of certain things we as people could do well to reflect on for awhile, all in a few short lines or so..well, that to me is valuable in art. \n\nI could go on about the great animation, and how I as a 28 year old graduate student enjoyed the reprieve of comedy others might disparage as childish or unrefined, or how Nezuko is adorable and Chuntaro is best girl- but none of that or the other things I don\'t have much more time to mention seem necessary for me to elucidate my main point. \n\nDemon Slayer does what it tries to do entrancingly well from where I was sitting. Sure, there\'re things I could draw attention to which weren\'t all that perfect in my assessment- but what\'s of critical importance here is I genuinely don\'t think any of it got in the way of me being enthralled with watching a show I was almost positive would\'ve been underwhelming. Lotta fun and looking forward to the movie premiering in the US and reading the manga past the anime. But really Chuntaro is precious\n              '",Demon Slayer
Mcgillacuddy,"b'\n                The shounen genre has seen a great deal of evolution in the past decade. For the last 10 years, shounen writers have strove to make their series the next big thing, and many have succeeded in different ways. The shounen genre stays true to its common tropes of heroism, hype battles, and, of course, what I like to call \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93dick-measuring contests\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd, because it always seems like there is a competition between characters to see who is the strongest and the main protagonist usually has full-fledged ambition to become the strongest. Whenever there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s an extremely powerful character at one point, another even more powerful guy comes\n                  ...\n          along. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s always that need for writers to break the limitations of their most formidable characters, usually to extend the life of the series. Anime like DBZ and Naruto are pinpoint perfect examples of that.\n\nPeople say that this genre is mainly aimed at the teen and young adult demographic, but to be completely honest, I believe that this genre has gone far beyond that point. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m 22 years old, and I still enjoy shounens depending on what they have to offer. Yes, I always expect the common tropes that come with the territory, but what I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been seeing lately is the fact that most modern shounens always include something unique, fresh, or exciting in order to gain your interest and hold it until you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re finished watching. You had the anime Hunter x Hunter, which drove itself on its masterful character development and writing. My Hero Academia drove itself on straightforwardness, including its fast pace, spectacular action, and positive ambition. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood drove itself on emotional impact and flawless character development. Attack on Titan drove itself on intensity and subversion of expectations. The shounen genre is virtually no longer something that should be aimed at a specific age demographic, because nearly every shounen has that something that sets it apart from others, giving them their own identities that can attract a multitude of anime fans regardless of age.\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba was an anime that was destined for popularity simply because it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a shounen, and anyone who has first heard of the anime from the get-go drew their attention to one word: ufotable. This studio most notably known for their contribution to the Fate series, namely Fate/Stay Night UBW and Fate/Zero. Ufotable was praised for their animation and visual design in both installments, and even though Fate is a series that I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t see being talked about often, ufotable still made a name for themselves through it in which that recognition would work its way into Kimetsu no Yaiba. I went into the anime with zero expectations except for the fact that I knew it was from ufotable. In fact, before I started watching, I had no idea that it was a shounen anime. I practically figured it out 2 episodes in. \n\nLike any shounen, the premise of Kimetsu no Yaiba is simple. The anime takes place in a world that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s ravaged by demons (not demon spirits, but basically just humans turned into monsters with special abilities) that feed on human flesh. The story follows a young boy named Tanjiro, who finds his entire family and village killed by demons, with his sister, Nezuko, surviving the onslaught but has turned into a demon herself. Seeing that Nezuko can somehow resist the urge to eat humans, Tanjiro goes on a journey to become a demon slayer and hopefully find a cure to turn Nezuko human again. \n\nRemember when I said that I figured out that this anime was a shounen 2 episodes in? Everything about the beginning of this anime was a dead giveaway. Right off the bat, we have a protagonist who is ambitious to train himself to become stronger in order to accomplish a specific goal. This should be the trademark trope for the entire shounen genre, but because of it, I was afraid that I would end up turning away from the anime. Yes, this is a shounen anime. I watched the whole thing, and I can honestly say that the story itself is nothing new. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s nothing unique about what the anime does with its characters that separates it from other shounens. If there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s nothing unique with the story or characters, then why do I obviously have an extremely positive opinion towards it, to the point where I just slap a 10 on it?\n\nDirecting, novelty, and pacing. Remember when I mentioned how shounens have something that drives their stories and gives them their own identities in turn? The things that drive Kimetsu no Yaiba are its directing, novelty, and pacing. I have many reasons to slap 10s on certain anime, and I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve done so with quite a few. Even when I know of their flaws, if the aspects that drive their stories are impactful enough to raise my level of excitement and interest to the point of blowing me away, then you get my vote, whether it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s an 8, 9, or 10. They\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re different levels of enjoyability, but those numbers are all highly positive. With Kimetsu no Yaiba, I was expecting the anime to only get worse, but I was seeing the opposite. Every episode, it just kept getting more and more exciting to watch. Let me explain how it handles its 3 aspects:\n\nDirecting:\n\nAn example of a shounen anime that has very good directing is My Hero Academia. While its shounen tropes and flaws are obvious to the eye, the directing is what makes it so fun to watch. The writer of the anime knew exactly what it was: a superhero anime, and was bent on keeping it that way by making it uplifting and heroic. In the case of Kimetsu no Yaiba, the impact value from its directing revolves around beauty in a treacherous world-build. This anime is violent and menacing, yet it is still one of the most gorgeous and attractive anime I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve seen. One of the best examples of how beauty is implemented in its story is through the villains of the series. The demons aren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t evil just to be so, which is how they are made out to be at first, but later down the line, you realize that they are all sheep who slave away under a single person. They\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re evil because they have no choice but to be so, and the way the anime directs every villain\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s backstories and hardships generates sympathy for each of them. Almost every villain death is shown in highly artistic fashions, in both explosive (i.e. Zenitsu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s kills) and slow, tranquil (i.e. Tanjiro giving a soft death to the spider girl) manners. \n\nThese critical moments left a huge impact on me, because I rarely see anime present violence in a way that can be seen as beautiful rather than simply brutal and harsh. The way the anime is directed through its treacherous world-build immersed me further into the ride. It made me care more about the characters like they were real people, and this is considering the shounen tropes. Yet, the next two aspects also apply to the directing:\n\nPacing:\n\nThis anime is extremely well-paced in nearly every aspect. There is no part of this that is rushed or tedious, and pacing is something that many shounens have an extremely hard time getting right. This is another thing that the first season of MHA did so well. If it was going to be an anime about superheroes, the focus of it was directed more towards its action than trying to conjure up a deep and complex story (which is also something I think an anime like Sword Art Online struggles at doing). MHA had a focus and it stuck with it, which is what Kimetsu no Yaiba also does well in a similar fashion. This anime is focused mainly on its artistic drive through the treachery and dangers of its world. It builds itself on intensity and keeping the viewer excited and hungry for more action. Action sequences are very well-placed throughout the anime to the point where it rarely slows down, because even in its slow moments, I was always hyped to see more action and more beauty.\n\nNovelty:\n\nThe animation, the music, the action choreography\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6 they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re all spectacular. The pacing in the fights are excellent. They are all extremely tense and fast-paced, and every single one did better than the last. It seemed like whenever there was one incredible fight, the next fight outdid that and so on. Ufotable makes utilization of every single strength under their belt, including the unique art, use of CGI, and spectacular visuals and special effects. The art in this anime really stands out, especially considering how two-dimensional and flat the characters look, yet the way ufotable seamlessly makes them blend in with the more three-dimensional environment is incredible. The soundtrack is fantastic, and is composed by the legendary Yuki Kajuira. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been a fan of her compositions since the first time I watched Sword Art Online. She is incredibly skilled at writing music that you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll turn your attention to while watching an anime, which is something that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to do for a lot of film composers. Compositions are mainly meant to be background music, but a multitude of tracks in Kimetsu no Yaiba don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t fade into the background like they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re supposed to. They simply stand out so much that they give me the initiative to keep an eye out for a soundtrack release. \n\nKimetsu no Yaiba is not a perfect anime in any way. You may believe that the anime doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t deserve the perfect score, even if you are positive towards it, but I rate anime based on my enjoyment of them and not by how perfect I think they are. I know fully well that Kimetsu no Yaiba is very flawed, yet it has the drive that heightened its impact value, and there are so many moments throughout that blew me away. This is really all dependent on how I viewed the anime. I may be exaggerating my descriptions in this review. I may be making too much of a big deal out of it, but hey, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d much rather make mountains out of molehills than miss out on some worthwhile entertainment.\n              '",Demon Slayer
ParzivaI_,"b'\n                After seeing these pictures and memes all over social media I decided to finally take a look into Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba). I came with many many doubts and prejudices only to be wronged in so many goddamn ways. Demon Slayer was a whole other ride.\n\nStory: (7/10)\nOur main character Tanjiro lives a quite pleasant life with his mother and siblings until one day he comes home to find his family slaughtered by a demon. The only survivor, his sister Nezuko, was turned into a demon. Tanjiro now tries everything to become a demon slayer himself to get revenge on the demon who killed his\n                  ...\n          family but most importantly turn his sister back to human. \nDemon slayer is your typical shonen anime. That doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t mean the story is bad per se but is by no means unique or new. The plot itself is good enough to keep you attached and interested tho and it has its own twist here and there. Overall I enjoyed the pacing and storytelling.\n\nCharacters: (9/10)\nI\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m actually not a fan of shonen myself because most of the time I get annoyed with half of the cast (looking at you Naruto, bhna, etc). But with Demon Slayer its different. Yes Tanjiro is your typical shonen character: optimistic, dedicated, selfless, calm and just lovable. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d usually hate him because he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s supposed to be  this dumb, na\xc3\x83\xc2\xafve clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 protagonist\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6 but he ain\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t. Despite his optimistic self you won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t ever see him acting dumb or careless for others, he has a mind of his own and he uses it. and holy shit he is badass.  I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t want to go on talking too much about Tanjiro even tho he is probably one of my favourite shonen protagonist but there are so many characters besides him that are insanely well written.\nOur second main character is Nezuko and despite her having like one line in the whole series, you can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t but love her. She\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just way too adorable. (Can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t wait for a 2nd season to show her badass demon side). Other than those two, we get introduced by some other characters, the most important ones being zenitsu and Inosuke. Zenitsu is rather plain and boring characters, crying over girls and fearing everything  (he gets more interesting in the manga later on). Inosuke is your\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6 not your typical character. I tried comparing him so someone but I just can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t. Wearing a boar mask and two katanas, he stole from a demon slayer he runs around trying to fight anyone he meets. After getting smashed by Tanjiro he follows him around, always wanting to fight him again to prove he is better. Compared to all these kind and nice characters he is the perfect fit for the main group of characters. \nCharacter development isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t lacking either and already in the first few episode we see Tanjiro evolve and develop some ground. Other characters sharing their amount of development as well. For characters like Nezuko and Zenitsu we will have to wait as we approach their insane  development in the manga.\n\t\nArt & Animation: (10/10)\nDemon slayer has by far the best animation I have seen in an anime. From the tense fighting moments to landscapes and even the funny moments in manga style, it just fits. There are no such things as static images, low effort fighting scenes, etc. The scenery is simply breathtaking and even though I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not really into 3D animation Demon Slayer did an insane job mixing up 2D with a few 3D animations. Tanjiros waterstyle feels so smooth and is just beautifully animated. The fighting scenes gets you hyped everytime, its insane. Big probs to the studio, this animation and art style is top notch.\n\nSoundtrack: (10/10)\nWith Gurenge performed by LiSA we get greeted by one of the best anime openings of all time. It simply fits and manages to give me goosebumps every single time I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m listening to it. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a banger. The ending is really good as well. What stands out is the stunning, exiting music coming with every single fighting scene. It has been a while since I got hooked by an anime like this. But the music and animation work so well together its impossible not to cheer for your favorite character. I had to calm myself down sometimes because fighting scenes got tense to the point where I just wanted to scream my lungs out.\n\nConclusion:\nDemon slayer has by no means the most unique stories or characters. The anime ain\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t perfect but it is close as hell. The Animation as well as music makes up for the rather generic storylines and the characters get such a deep and interesting exploration throughout the season, you feel yourself falling for the whole universe. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not a shonen fan by any means and I went into this anime with really high doubts. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m glad to be proven wrong. I fell in love with almost each and every character to the point, I immediately started reading the manga after finishing the anime. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s why I have to give demon slayer a well-deserved 10/10. I highly recommend you to look into the anime yourself, even if it doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t seem to be your cup of tea.\n              '",Demon Slayer

Since turning your brain off is a prerequisite to enjoying most shounen anime, I\'ve generally avoided properties licensed with Shonen Jump. Hero Academia is a big exception, but that\'s because it\'s a show that you can hardly avoid (probably like Naruto and Dragon Ball in their own times). I actually love that show, which is the main reason why I was willing to give Demon\n                  ...\n          Slayer a shot.\n\nSo, how does Shonen Jump\'s newest cash cow stack up? Actually, pretty well.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong. The writing is just okay. It\'s littered with tropes and it doesn\'t set itself apart in any way. For my own sake, I didn\'t go into this shounen anime with high writing expectations. Instead, at the very least, I expected to see some masterful fighting animation. After all, that\'s where all of this show\'s buzz is coming from (as well as the oni-waifu). And I\'m glad to say that I saw the magic. This show\'s animation is stellar.\n\nWhat can I say. The animation is simply amazing. It may seem off-topic, but I swear it isn\'t: when I watched this show, the episodes didn\'t feel like they were 24 minutes long. While watching this show, time seemed to flow by without my knowledge. Before I knew it, I\'d watched 16 episodes in one sitting. I can safely attribute that to this show\'s pure visual quality.\n\nUsually when I watch a show, I end up getting exhausted from silently nit-picking every frame where a character is staring off into space or whenever a character is moving unnaturally choppily. These flaws don\'t largely exist in Demon Slayer. Almost every scene in this show has the animation quality of a good anime fight scene. It felt like nothing was unintentional- even when it  didn\'t necessarily matter. \n\nMore importantly, though, the fight scenes... I mean... Words can\'t really do them justice. The only flaw that I could see in the fight scenes lied in the generic nature of each protagonist\'s attacks. If the choreography was on-par with My Hero Academia, then this show would have been an easy 10.\n\nSo, yeah, Demon Slayer is awesome. It\'s not the best show I\'ve seen, but it\'s really good. I\'d Recommend it.\n              '",Demon Slayer
VengefulAura,"b'\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba or rather Demon Slayer is a shounen about a boy named Tanjiro who seeks to turn his demon sister Nezuko back into a human by reaching the source of the demons. Muzan Kibetsuji. \n\nStory (8): \nThis may sound like a typical shounen by the plot synopsis, but throughout the season it expands and gets better by each episode and by the end of it, you\'ll be begging for more episodes. The plot us unique, ""a boy wants to save his sister and avenge his deceased family by killing the source of his sisters demonhood/families murderer in hope to make her human again.\n                  ...\n          It works well and it\'s an engaging plot. \n\nArt (10): I mean honestly, this shows art/animation direction are absolutely breathtaking. All characters are vibrant and full of color. Each characters moveset boisters stunning detail and animation that will cause your jaw to drop. Same can be said for the demons blood arts. Landscapes and backgrounds range from being full of life with a happy mood to being dark and evil feeling. It adds so much tension in the right moments and it knows when to lighten things up depending on the atmosphere. Ufotable knows what they all doing.\n\nSound (10): The sound design is incredible as well. From the sound of swords coming out of there sheathes, too the sound of the instruments used within the anime. It adds a whole new depth to some scenes, especially near the end of episode 19, which is an amazing episode.\n\nCharacter (9): Our main cast of protagonists are Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke are all so different from one another. Tanjiro is just a normal boy who isn\'t overpowered and he knows that, he\'s very human, selfless and will do whatever it takes to save his sister and defeat any demon that threatens them. Zenitsu is an odd ball for sure with his split personalities. Most of the time he is scared of everything in the most hilarious way, he gets easily jealous when girls talk to Tanjiro and sometimes when a demon is in his way, his mood completely shifts and he becomes a powerful demon slayer, a side no one knows about, even himself. Inosuke is a competition freak. Everything revolves around him. He loves being loud and will fight too the bitter end and hates feeling inferior to others. Nezuko harbors the look of a demon but the heart of a human and she will not attack humans. She will fight for her brother Tanjiro at the right moments. In my opinion the best arc in this season is the Demon Family arc with Lower Rank 5 Kizuki Demon Rui. Amazing.\n\nMuch more can be said about a few of the Hashiras including Shinobu and Giyuu but you need to watch this show. \n\nEnjoyment/Overall: (9):  To me this show felt like a breath of fresh air with Ufotable at the helm. It makes me even more excited knowing there is a movie releasing next year to continue the story, (Infinity Train Arc) and maybe season 2 will release in 2021. If you love a shounen with lots of action, character building, cool and interesting demons as foes for our protagonists, with a great engaging plot, give this anime a go. I absolutely recommend it.\nThe stories only just begun.\n              '",Demon Slayer
banimewatcher123,"b'\n                This is one of the best shonen i have ever watched. I feel in a shonen anime story isnt everything.  \n \nStory: 7.5\nit has a pretty solid story and develops well. There is no lag in the story. It is pretty predictable but again this is a shonen , so having a predictable story isnt wrong. People call demon slayer story horrible writing, they are wrong!!! Its not horrible. Why do people except a show like AOT all the time. It is actually a bit different from classic shonen. Usually the protagonist wants be or achieve something so that they can become stronger. But\n                  ...\n          here thats not the case. Tanjiro is someone who didn\'t know demons existed and had his family slaughtered but his sister turned into a demon. His only aim is to just live peaceful life and save his sister. He dosen\'t want be pirate king or hokage or hero. And this anime has very less plot armors unlike classic shonen. In the manga the writer didn\'t hesitate to kill characters. Really unique in its own way as a shonen.\n\nCharacter: 7 \nCharacter development was not bad, we get know each characters back story be it a demon slayer or a demon. The story has just started and it is too early to judge. I already watched the demon slayer movie and it was amazing. So we have to wait for season 2 to get to know more about the characters.\n\nSound: 10\nAmazing sound effects. The flowing water sound and the sound tracks are amazing.\nThere is no mistake in any sound effects. Sometimes u feel like ""this scene could have been better"" but for me it wasnt like that. \n\nArt: 10\nU cant see a better shonen anime for me in terms of art. Its just too good. Ufo table have done an amazing job. Ep 19 was one of the best shonen anime episode i have ever seen. it not only blew me away with the animation but also the effect it had emotionally. It shows the bond between these two sibilings that is very hard to break. If people complain about the flashbacks i dont care. Most of the shonen animes have horrible amount of flashbacks. It is also later explained that these flashbacks come when a person is on verge to death. Ufo table did a better job in the mugen train movie in terms of art.\n\nEnjoyment: 9\nBe it the serious moments, Sad moments or funny moments i really enjoyed this show. it is really good and enjoyable for me. Prople miight have over hyped it, but if a show is hyped it dosent mean it is bad.\n\nOverall: 8.5\nIt was an amazing show to watch i am looking forward to season 2.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Copyboy-13,"b""\n                *No Spoilers. It has been 6 months since I finished Demon Slayer. I've watched about 100 animes since then and now, I think I can review it. I decided one summer evening to watch anime. I chose Kimetsu no Yaiba because I heard it was good. I only watched My Hero Academia, Season 1 of Sword Art Online, and about 60 episodes of Fairy Tail. Other than Ghibli movies, I had no anime experience. I watched it and was completely engaged with the characters and art style. I didn't hear anything about episode 19, but when I finished it... I fell in love with the\n                  ...\n          medium that is anime. I was watching Kill la Kill and Ms. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid at the time so, I didn't have that much to relate it to. But...It changed me. I was a typical gamer before then. But I became a full on weeb. I binged about 20 more series throughout the rest of summer, 70 series in the fall, and now I'm already 15 series in this winter.\n\n*Now to talk about the actual show.\n\nSTORY: 8\nI think the story is really solid. The first episode sets us up for us to root for our main characters: Tanjiro and Nezuko. The following episodes set us up for the rest of the series teaching us about the upcoming threats and battle system. Overall solid and enjoyable.\n\nART: 9\nThe art is amazing in this show. The art style is unique compared to other animes, and the animation from Ufotable is some of their best. (I still haven't watched much of the Fate series.) The camera work is masterful and the effects for the attacks are really beautiful. Almost like someone is attacking me with ocean waters straight out of a painting. I also really enjoy the choreography. Highlights are the the arrow fight, drum fight, and episode 19 fight. Overall... amazing job Ufotable!\n\nSOUND: 7\nI love the sound effects for the attacks, and the ost can shift from beautiful, all the way to hype. Buuut... I feel it wasn't the biggest muscle that was flexed compared to other animeIt was never bad, but I never felt the need to gush about it. I do think the voice acting was really good. I watched it subbed.\n\nCHARACTER: 8\nI like almost all the characters. ZENITSU!!! (Sigh) I liked his backstory, but I thought he just a creep and wuss for most of the show. He displayed a lot of character when he protected the box and when he finished his final battle, but other than that. I guess he was fine. Other than that, likeable characters, and amazing designs.\n\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 9\nI love Demon Slayer. It will be in my heart as the kickstarter for my weeb days, and I thought it was very well made. I am proud to call this one of my favorite animes despite how normie it now is.\n              """,Demon Slayer
b_schultheiss,"b""\n                Alright so I am noticing that at least the top comments for this show are all from people in about May who had only seen 7 or 8 episodes by that point. The anime although was still extremely good back then, it does not even come close to comparing to what it is now. \nThe fighting and the development of Tanjiro and Nezuko is taken to a whole new level to the point where they aren't even just protecting one another now, but able to fight as a well oiled machine exponentially increasing both of their strengths. \nThe animation of course is amazing and the\n                  ...\n          voice acting is as well, but the animation really does shine in episode 19, the latest episode, probably one of the most beautifully and well done fight scenes of all of anime. I cannot remember a time that a fight scene has left me in awe and goosebumps for so long, I just can't seem to stop myself from watching this one scene over and over again. It was so good that I may even say that watching the anime is more than worth it just to see this scene. The ED that they used for this scene as well just made it even better, in fact without the music I dare say that the fight scene may have just been amazing instead of spectacular. \n\nCharacters-9\nAnimation-10\nVoice acting-9\nPlot-8\nFighting-10\nMusic-9\n              """,Demon Slayer
SevenTales,"b""\n                While the show is certainly a visual treat, it lacks originality and depth of character.\nWhile the show began slow, it's worldbuilding and atmosphere were two great points going for it. But the atmosphere slowly morphed as we piled on more characters, and the show slid into a more traditional, and uninspired, battle shonen. The interesting characters are few and far between, with standout annoying performances (the two sidekicks especially, are walking tropes taken to extremes) which completely destroyed the earlier feel of the show.\nKimetsu no Yaiba is a decent, if unoriginal, battle shonen. If you like these kinds of animes, the visuals alone should keep\n                  ...\n          you entertained as it is by far its strong suit. The animations are normally great and sometimes downright gorgeous with effective use of colors and CGI to create some scenes that truly stand out from more mundane shonen scenes. \nIt's a technical achievement if anything. I can hope for bigger and better battles in the future of the show, even if I now know what to expect from its mediocre at best storytelling.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Brianiac,"b'\n                Demon slayer: kimetsu no yabai is an actual work of art, and forever will go down in anime history as being one of  ""the greats""\n\nthe story is a typical revenge plot, MC ""tanjiiro""  finds his family hurt, and goes out on a revenge path to find the one who hurt them and the one who possessed his sister, along the way  he finds numerous friends and allys, and of course horrifying enemies ""demons"" with godly powers, each one more stronger than the last\n\nthe art style is absolutely stunning. It uses the perfect blend of CGI and Hand drawn animations. Not one character\n                  ...\n          uses any cgi or 3d models *to my knowledge* , nor does any one use of CGI stick out horribly like a sore thumb  *like most cg aspects usually do*\n\nthe fight choreography is also just as stunning, seeing the liquid like flows of their swords slashing through heads,the twists and turns to avoid attacks and so on. Each demon has unique powers and fighting styles,  no two demons have similarities. *except maybe the spider family* \n\nthe character design is kinda typical. It has the overpowered MC, younger sister he wants to protect, lazy best friend, and super show off shmuck that  thinks hes better  when he clearly isnt,  but it all oddly works out for this show.\n\noverall i give this show/series a perfect 10/10, maybe a 9.9, \nas im not  a big fan of a show building up a super awesome storyline, just to say ""FIND OUT IN THE MOVIE"" i wish they could have progressed it more\nbut apparently the story arc for the movie is also one of the best arcs in any shounen  manga of all time, so i am also hyped for the movie\n\nTLDR; this show is a work of art, super solid art and animations, story, choreography all of it\n              '",Demon Slayer
SCUBAST3V3N,"b'\n                For the past two seasons of anime, I\'ve had the pleasure of watching Kimetsu no Yaiba, for me, there was never a dull moment. My first time watching the opening, and seeing the art, I thought to myself, they surely can\'t consistently have artistic and animation quality of that level right?\n\nStory: The show grips you immediately, places you in the shoes of Tanjiro, who lives in the mountains with his mother and siblings. He takes care of his chores to help the family survive; gathering wood, trips to town to sell and buy goods for the family, etc. One day, he returns to find his\n                  ...\n          family brutally slaughtered by demons, the only one clinging to life, his sister, Nezuko, this begins their journey. While searching for a way to turn his sister back into a human, they become entrenched in the demon slayer corps, and their battle against not only the demons, but against Muzan and the twelve Kizuki as well.\n\nArt: Man, it\'s good. A little too good if you ask me. It leaves me questioning whether or not UFOtable can keep up this level of animation throughout the full length that this anime ends up running. I\'m not very artistic, nor do I have a ton of knowledge of the techniques, but whatever technique they use for drawing the elemental breathing technique stuff, is absolutely breathtaking. It makes the fight scenes stand out from every other anime in my opinion- because it hasn\'t really been done before, at least not at this level of quality, as far as I know.\n\nSound: They hit you in the mouth right off the bat with the kickass Gurenge by LiSA, and the music choices throughout the show always fit the mood, and felt incredibly cinematic. The voice acting was spot on as well, you could generally feel the emotions when they were present. \n\nCharacters: Man, the cast of characters in this anime, was outstanding. Of course, you have Tanjiro and Nezuko taking the lead, but, they did such an amazing job of making every character that joined the fray have their own personality and emotions, generally from their past. You don\'t find many animes where they genuinely make you feel for almost every villain that\'s encountered along the way, but they made it happen with this. It played to the idea that ""maybe demons aren\'t all bad"" because you had moments in their deaths, where you could see the very human side of them. It was incredibly well done.\n\nEnjoyment: As someone who works weekdays, this anime made my Saturdays even more enjoyable. I was able to roll out of bad after 10am, plop on the couch, and allow myself to get lost in the story that is Kimetsu no Yaiba. I consider this a Spring anime, because of when it started, so, it easily took the cake as my favorite anime of the Spring, and that carried over into the Summer as well, although, the competition was quiet a bit higher in the summer IMO.\n\nOverall: 10/10 easy. It\'s uncommon when I have an anime that just gets a 10 in my mind with little to no thought behind it, and that was the case here. It just felt so obvious to me that it was a 10, with just how much I enjoyed this show. I look forward to the movie, and hopefully numerous seasons to come.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Maykii,"b""\n                Demon Slayer is one of the greatest animated series I have ever watched and I recommend any fan of Shounen anime to give it a watch. It has a great plot, loveable characters, beautiful animation and an amazing soundtrack. Every episode left me hooked for the next one and many left me with my jaw dropping or laughing numerous times so I'm going to review why this was a great show and why you should watch it.\n\nPlot:\n\nDemon Slayer is set in a period of Japanese history which is often overlooked, the Taish\xc3\x85\xef\xbf\xbd period. This was a period in history where Japan had very much modernised\n                  ...\n          but rural and traditional lifestyle was still not uncommon which makes for a very interesting setting where we can have 20th century technology along side katanas which isn't something you see everyday. As you can guess by the name of the show, there is demons and there is demon slayers who slay them. The demon slayers themselves are unrecognised by the government and operate more in rural areas meaning a lot of people are unaware of the demons. Our main protagonist is Tanjiro Kamado, a young boy from a poor family whose whole family is murdered by a demon except for his younger sister, Nezuko. Nezuko is turned into a demon and Tanjiro joins the demon slayers in hope of finding a way to cure his sister. I won't spoil anymore of the plot since its worth a watch but thats the general idea.\n\nCharacters:\n\nCompared to most Shounen anime Demon Slayer has a pretty small cast, there is four main characters and each of them do a great job of representing different aspects of the world in this story. Tanjiro is one of the greatest protagonists I have ever seen and he is a great role model as he is extremely kind and is willing to do anything for his sister and his friends. Throughout the series we see him motivate others through hard times as he has been through very hard times himself he is very understanding of others. Unlike a lot of Shounen protagonists he is not overpowered and sustains great damage in battle which have long term effects. The rest of the cast also is very representative. Nezuko shows a lot of courage and love to go against her instincts to help others, Zenitsu represents the fear of people and his view of himself as an ordinary guy against the more courageous demon slayers and the demons themselves is interesting. Inosuke shows how there is much more to just believing that you can win which overall I think is a great part of this anime, how it doesn't rely on friendship and other bullcrap and actually applies logic while still showing how values are important. The characters all have their own quirks which allow for fun moments too though some may find it obnoxious which I can understand I think the balance between humour and seriousness is done very well. The rest of the cast is enjoyable too though some may think the pillars are boring with one line personality traits though they still need to be developed next season as I also thought the same of Tomioka and Shinobu until they were developed more.\n\nAnimation:\n\nThis is definitely the shows strongest point and it is why it became so popular. The animation is done by ufotable which is a phenomenal studio most know for the Fate series. I'm not usually a big fan of CGI in anime but here it looks absolutely breathtaking. I've rewatched many of the fights numerous times because of how clean they are. Episode 19 and 26 in particular look phenomenal. The art style is very distinct but it doesn't look out of place at all, the backdrops and environments look beautiful. Many effects are used which I haven't seen much in anime before and it is very surprising how good they look especially for a TV series.\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nIt's amazing, the opening and ending are great songs which get you hyped up for the episode and the one after especially considering the great cliffhangers this series has. The background music is beautiful too, it uses a variety of instruments which really feel like you are in that time period. The battle music, the more upbeat music, the peaceful music... it all sounds fantastic. My favourite track has to be the music from the end of episode 19, I can't help but smile when hearing it during the action.\n\nOverall for me this show is 10/10 which is not something I say often but I was really captivated by it and it hooked me early on. If you like Shounen anime you should really check it out.\n              """,Demon Slayer

I very merging to watch this manga adaptation in all aspect. So i will give some review about aspect that i merging for :\n\nStory : (10) the story of KnY very very unique. All of story have continous thing and tidy plot. The story not just focus in Tanjirou as Main character, but make focus in all aspect in character (this make me feel so\n                  ...\n          ""wahh"").\n\nArt : (10) for art, we don\'t need to ask anymore, ufotable is the greates studios until now to produce the best act. they make every frame/picture so details and we know, ufotable is greatest for this case.\n\nSound : (10) nah, in this aspect i very very like. if i can rate this through 11, i will give this aspect rate\'s 11 from 11 (because this rate just until 10 hehe). ths ost, opening, and ending designed very well, especially in the ost. (By the way i very like the battle ost of KnY). for the opening and ending, we dont need to ask how LiSA perform\'s. She always perform in 100%, so that can make the op and ed very very good. But again, the ost will make you get goosebump.\n\nCharacter : (10) : in this aspect too make me fall in love with KnY, because the character in this series is unique. Almos all of character in KnY have sad past. and i very like the character development like tanjirou from weak until he strong and other character.\n\nEnjoyment : (10) if you need to enjoy your self after you got tired in work, you can watch this series. this series contain has a comedy side, have a little romance, and almost the great action and adventure is very well mix in this series\n\nOverall : (10) for Overall, i rate this series 10 for sure.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Vety,"b""\n                (This is my seconde review, and the first one was really cringe, so please be gentle :) )\nDemon Slayer is not overrated.\nI gotta admit, I didn't have such high expectations when I started watching Demon Slayer (plus I didn't read the manga). Honestly, I was kinda scared to the idea that this could be like, I don't know, a basic ecchi (I was fully aware of the Nezuko fanbase, guys she's like 15) or just a sequence of too many arcs, not really linked to each other. I was wrong, and I am going to tell you why :\n\nStory : 8\nA young man, who wants\n                  ...\n          to cure his demon sister, and occasionally slaughtering every single other demons in his area (yeah, it looks like a certain type of ad, and I don't freaking care). As simple as it looks, it is surprisingly good. Like I said before, each arcs have its own background, its own characters (even if Tanjiro remains the MC), its own particularity. Moreover these arcs remain connected, in one way or another. The story becomes more complex, and it makes the anime pretty decent on this point.\n\nArt : 10\nI'm going to be really quick and unoriginal about the art : it's absolutely stunning. Demon Slayer has the best art I have ever seen in an anime, especially during the fights scenes. Watch it, and you'll understand.\n\nSound : 9\nI want to be honest with you, usually I don't pay attention to sound effects or music, because I find it very basic in most of the cases. But damn, that's not how it worked here. The soundtracks in Demon Slayer are completely different from the modern music we can hear in another anime ; we feel, like, an ancient Japan atmosphere (the story is happening during the 1910's). Another time, our anime stands out from the rest, for the better.\n\nCharacter : 9\nI think there are 2 things that define a good anime character : first, how far can it go without being annoying, and then, of course, its development. What can I say except that almost every character has an unique development ??? The further you go, the harder it becomes to say who is the best girl and who is the best boy. If I had one advice to give you, think carefully before judging anyone.\n\nEnjoyment : 10\nYou enjoyed the first episode ? Congratulations, you'll enjoy the rest. Just like me !\n\nOverall : 9\nAfter such a favourable review, it seems evident that I consider Demon Slayer as a really, really good anime. Thanks for reading !\n              """,Demon Slayer
GreecesVeryOwn,"b'\n                (WARNING: May Contain Spoilers. I will label spoilers as the review goes along)\nThis is my first review ever\n\nDemon Slayer is like watching art being painted on a canvas. It\'s natural beauty makes this show amazing to watch. \n\nStory: 7/10\nThe story of Demon Slayer is extremely interesting, but isn\'t necessarily unique and complex. There is a simple yet effective resolve from Tanjiro that drives the plot forward. This simple resolve plus the world around Tanjiro makes the plot move in a way that isn\'t bad, but doesn\'t have an unique setting. The resolve itself is not unique, as FMA:B has the same endgame, but ultimately does\n                  ...\n          it better. While the plot itself is good, it does not feel unique, but is boosted based on characters. The development of how Tanjiro becomes a Demon Slayer is developed well enough. The plot itself is developed well, however, it is a simple plot and resolve that don\'t make it unique.\n\nArt: 10/10\nUfotable outdoes itself in regards to art. (spoiler) Episode 19\'s clean transition from water to fire style is extremely well done and so clean (spoiler end). The slices of the sword feel so real due the clean animation. The use of motion tracking in some of the episodes make it so much more interesting. The landscapes and scenery itself is breathtaking, and it shows itself in Episodes 1-4, where the wildlife is so vibrant. It uses its animation to push the story. Zenitsu\'s use of his style is so rare, yet it looks the cleanest of them all. Giyu\'s unique style is like watching art unfold behold your eyes. The character designs themselves are unique, yet are amazing. The characters emotions are fully displayed by their animations and facial expressions. I heard from somewhere that it\'s like watching art on scree, and I can agree\n\nSound: 10/10\nThe sound of Demon Slayer is unique but beautiful. To start, the OP created by the legendary LiSA, is one of the best modern OP\'s I\'ve seen. The OST""s themselves are amazing. They fit the emotions for their sole purpose. When there are emotional scenes, you get hit with the piano or the flute, with hard rock scenes you get hit a guitar, and of course, the creepy scenes use that choir that fills the air with eeriness. When they all mix together, it is some of the most impactful pieces of music that move you, for no reason. The music choice is superb throughout the story\n\nCharacter: 8/10\nThe characters in this story are engaging, entertaining, and likeable. To start, the Main Character himself has a resolve that is simple, effective, and obtainable. Compared to Shoneon tropes where one wants to be ""the king"" of something, Tanjiro\'s resolve is not for selfish purposes, but to help the others. His comprehension and sympathy for others far surpasses other MC\'s. His character is written very well and mature for an MC. Then we have Nezuko, who\'s character is fascinating and loveable. The fact she\'s able to comprehend humans who are good and her family despite her being a demon makes her a great character. She can help herself but also help others. Her empathy and caringness despite the condition she\'s in makes her a great character. Of course there are the two sidekicks, Zenitsu and Inosuke. Zenitsu is a more developed character, and his backstory is so interesting. Of course he is used as comic relief for most of the time, but his serious moments do engage the audience. Insuke is arguably the weakest link, as his behavior is only barely justified and he doesn\'t develop, thus leaving him an one dimensional character used for comic relief. While there are other side characters that I truly enjoy, such as Giyu, Shnobu, they don\'t get enough screen time, but add to the depth of characters. In regards to the Demon, I believe they are the weakest part overall. The demons resolve is unclear. While some demons have interesting backstories, some of them fall flat. The main villian does not show clear intent at all through the series and leaves me confused. However, the Demons that Tanjiro fights are somewhat interesting to see, especially Rui, who is the most interesting Demon. \n\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nI enjoyed this show for it\'s interesting world building, the likeable and deep characters, the good and comprehendible plot, and the impact of the art and sound, left me engaged and loving this show. I did enjoy this show a lot and how things played out\n\nOverall: 9/10\nDemon Slayers unique art and amazing sound, the likeable characters, and comprehendible and good plot make this show very interesting and a great watch. It\'s simple complexity keeps me craving more of this show.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Guiltena,"b'\n                I started watching this because LiSA sang the opening. Cutting to the chase: This is a simple, yet great anime.\n\nThe story isn\'t very complex (so far) and everything is well-explained. I felt like the pace was a tiny little too fast a few times but nothing grave: one time it was because of a timeskip of two years, so all is good here.\nCharacter introductions? Made sense, nobody came in ""unexpected"" - that is to say, unrelated and out of space.\nI\'m kinda missing a little more complexity here, so the story gets a 7 (good) from me. There also were a lot of funny scenes!\n\nThe artstyle\n                  ...\n          takes a little getting used to - they all look like kids, even if they\'re adults. Personally, it was a little of a downside for me because I\'m a sucker for good looks. I would also say it has a good aspect to it too: it made me focus more on the storyline.\nEach of the characters is uniquely designed. Their facial shape may be the same, but the eyes aren\'t. Their eye design differs greatly from each other, if you compare.\nThe animation? Chef\'s kiss, very nice with some 3d elements, very smooth. I particularly liked the Water Breathing Technique\'s animations.\n\nSound 10 of 10 because Gurenge as the opening? Perfect. The OSTs were great as well, very fitting, got a vibe of past Japan.\n\nAll the characters are nice, well made. Certainly not perfect but that\'d be boring anyway. There is a lot of room for character development for certain characters.\nI liked the dumb main trio very much. They all seem a little bit of stupid but all three are different kinds of stupid. While Tanjiro is dense, Inosuke has exactly zero percent of human competences Zenitsu always seems stupid but that\'s because he whines so much. This trio is very dynamic. They fit each other well.\nAnother aspect I like about them is the healthy rivalty they\'ve got.\n\nI really enjoyed this series throughout and it\'s definitely worth the watch. I\'ll stay tuned for another update!\n              '",Demon Slayer

tomioka_hashira,"b'\n                ""When the happiness is destroyed, there\'s always blood smell""\n\nKeep this quote on your brain, cause yes: this will happen basically anytime on the anime. I\'ll not coil right there, so let\'s start.\n\nStory: 10/10 [SPOILERS]\n\nSo, I\'m not actually sure what was the last shounen that I saw in my life (I think it was attack on titan, but only the 1st season or something), but I only started to watch this one because a lot of people didn\'t stop to talk about this show. And yeah, I know: Kimetsu No Yaiba is overhyped as fuck. But, to be honest, I really don\'t give a single f*cking\n                  ...\n          care about it. If the anime is good or not, that\'s the only thing that matters. I started to watch because a lot of people reccomended to me, so why not? And this one is also a unique case, cause: I was advised that, on the plot, there\'s a very slightly spoiler of the 1st episode. And when I heard that, I was automatically thinking of not reading the plot, because I wanted to feel the real tension of the 1st episode. But, only by hearing the people talking about, I already knew the general things of the show, like: there\'s demons, there\'s swordsmans, there\'s the protagonist, there\'s swords, there\'s powers, and etc. The story of Kimetsu No Yaiba (or Demon\'s Slayer) takes place on Japan (on the Tasho\'s age), where we have the protagonist Tanjiro Kamado, that lives isolated (on an house, in the other side of an mountain), and in a poor family. One day, in order to help in the financial conditions, Tanjiro decided to go to the city (in the other side of the mountain), to sell a lot of coal to the citizens. And on the next day, coming back to home, Tanjiro was facing the worst situation ever: his entire family was dead by the forest demons. The only survivor was his younger sister Nezuko, but unfortunately she turned to an demon too, but in an specific case: she didn\'t want to eat human flesh (she turned to an demon by the main villain: Kibutsuji Muzan, but after that, all humans are considered ""family"" by Nezuko), and she can\'t eat them (and yes: Nezuko only can recover energy by only sleeping a lot). With that, Tanjiro decided to pass by a very hard trainment, to be part of the ""Executors\' Squad"": to go to a lot of missions, kill a lot of demons, in order to avenge his family and find a way to make Nezuko turn back to an human. So, yeah the premise looks generic (it looks like it will be another classic shounen or something), but the way the things are shown is very unique. Because, as usual, we have a lot of demons (which are villains on the anime), but the majority of them were also humans, that had stories, had lives, and something. And because of sufferings, pains, and compilations, the majority of them were turned to demons by Muzan (due to their pains that they had). And when they die, they basically are sent to the sky, with thie sins forgiven. And yeah, with that, we also have some refferences with, at least, three animes (as my brain can remember): 1st - Naruto: because yeah, wanting or not, there\'s some refferences to japanese culture, like: the use of kimonos, hashis to eat, the japanese cooking, the japanese religion (that can be identified by the Kagura\'s dance, made by the deceased father of Tanjiro, that always practice the dance to amaze pains and suffers from his family), and etc. 2nd - Akame Ga Kill: and yeah, there\'s who says that Demon\'s Slayer is an remastered version of akame ga kill, but it\'s not. Well, surprinsgly, I still didn\'t watch this show, but it\'s possible to fin some similarities, because we have the villains on both, and on both, the majority of people die (but the only difference is the emotional appealing of both: on Kimetsu is sadder, on Akame Ga Kill I can\'t say, but I think it\'s not on the same way). And 3rd - Angel Beats!: damn, this one also has some similarities too, like: the fact that we have sins on both animes (and like: characters that wanted to do some things, but they can\'t, because the life time is over, and that brings to them a lot of pains), etc. The only visible difference is: on Angel Beats, we have characters (already dead), and on Kimetsu No Yaiba, we have characters (on the same situation), but turned to demons (as the anime title suggests). Also, as I said: there\'s a lot of emotional appealing. Due to that fact (when the demons die, this is like a redemption), because we know about their stories, and we can identify ourselves sometimes with them. When I finished, I was like the Inosuke\'s voice actor: crying in the corners, specially with the Rui\'s story (to be more specific, the spider demon guy; the bottom five of the twelve kizuki). Because Rui was a child, with the incapability of walking and do almost everything. Unfortunately, Kibutsuji (seeing his suffering), he turned Rui to an demon (because in all the time, Rui was like blaming his parents, by the fact of being full of defects). And when he turned to an demon, after devoured his parents, the last words from his mother and father were: \n\n""I\'m sorry Rui. I\'m sorry for didn\'t give you a perfect body, but we did everything to make you happy as far as possible"".\n\nDAAAAAMN. His story just got me, and yes I cried so much with that story. I was sobbing so much. The saddest story on all the anime for sure. And I\'ll talk about the life lessons on the final section (overall). But, summing up, I really liked of Kimetsu No Yaiba, because the story leaves no loose ends, and explains literally everything. Really caught me: I laughed so much, I cried in some moments, I was short of breath (because there was a lot of moments that my adrenaline levels went crazily high), I was goosebumpy in a lot of scenes, and I got enchanted by almost everything. It looks a little bit ponderous, I know. Because we have a lot of bloodthirsty scenes, and deaths, and somethings. But, at least for me, this wasn\'t a problem. Clearly my heart hurted in those scenes, but I think that they were presented to show how the real human suffering can be. So, 10/10 to the story. REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY AMAZING.\n\nArt: 9/10\n\nIt\'s from Ufotable, so what can you expect? Well, basically: an stunning and uniquely amazing piece of art style. I mean: this is about Fate franchise. Because, I only watched the Fate/Stay Night seasons produced by Ufotable, and damn: the art of Fate is simply unique. It\'s so f*cking detailed, so real, the traces are basically amazing, the colors, the characters design and the scenarios are simply genious. And about Kimetsu No Yaiba, I think it was really so good as Fate series, but I think: we can\'t deny that Fate\'s art style is light-years, compared to Kimetsu. But Kimetsu is also very good too: I like the characters design of both; I like the CGI of both (and to be honest, they are the best animes with CGI use); I like the scenarios of both, and etc. But, on Kimetsu No Yaiba, sometimes, the art style looks more simple. Don\'t get me wrong: the art of Demon\'s Slayer is also fantastically amazing, but if you compare with Fate, it\'ll look more simple. Like the traces looks more childish sometimes, but they\'re very good too. And we can make some good hecking desktop wallpapers with the backgrounds and with the characters (and I think this will be a trend for years, because this anime don\'t stop to be so popular, even if it was launched like one year ago). So, the art is pretty great: the colors are so good, scenarios so good, characters design so good, the traces and the brightness so good, and all the fight scenes were very very well animated (I got goosebumps everytime I saw the fight scene between Tanjiro and Rui). But again guys: we can\'t deny that the Fate\'s art style is light-years better. But, overall 9/10: it\'s also uniquely great too.\n\nSound: 10/10\n\n10/10, and nothing less. Because, I really love the opening and the ending songs so much. The opening song (Gurenge), what can we say? Fantastically amazing too, like: it really gave me goosebumps literally everytime. LiSA is a very great singer at all, she didn\'t deserve to ""Autotune"" her voice, because she already have a great, excentric, and beautiful voice. The scenes that appear on the opening were very choose at all, the fast takes too. And with the ending, we can several wallpaper compilations to our desktops, right? The ending was also so good: the song, the scenes that show more about the Tanjiro\'s family. Yeah, sometimes I really wanted to go back, to just repeat the songs, because damn it\'s so addicting at all. The background soundtracks were amazing too. We have the right soundtracks on the: sad moments, on the fight scenes, and on the funny moments. The most addcting funny soundtrack was the background soundtrack on the Taisho\'s gossips scenes (after the final credits). And on the goosebumpy moments, there\'s always the best choices of soundtracks, to pass to you: a even bigger air of tension and despair. And yes, I liked of that. So, 10/10 to the soundtrack. Do you have the courage to say that the soundtracks are bad? I think not.\n\nCharacters: 9/10\n\nReally amazing too. *cof cof* Zenitsu *cof cof*........ LOL, okay I\'ll explain that later. So, summing the four main the characters:\n\n- Tanjiro: easily one of the best protagonist on all the shounen animes,  have a very good keen sense of smell, very courageous, funny, sweet, and sometimes, you\'ll have the willing of putting him inside of a little pot, due to his mood and cuteness at all;\n- Nezuko: the cutest demon girl on all the anime;\n- Zenitsu: one of the most annoying characters ever, yelling everytime, not so lucky when it comes to be attractive to girls, fearful, but funny at the same time;\n- Inosuke: the guy with an boar mask, that always chase Tanjiro (""I can do anything you do\'\', it\'s basically like that lmao), lives isolated, have a very good mood, and very funny too.\n\nAnd we also have the Hashiras (the nine most powerful characters on the anime, along with their master: Kagaya Ubuyashiki):\n\n- The bug pillar: Shinobu Kocho- The fire pillar: Kyojuro Rengoku\n- The water pillar: Giyuu Tomioka (and yes, I laughed so much when shinobu was bullying him, saying some things: ""no one likes you"", ""you don\'t have friends"", and etc. And the way that Giyuu reacts to these comments is so funny at all. I cracked with laughter so much, and this is also a meme too I think).\n- The love pillar: Mitsuri Kanroji\n- The wind pillar: Sanemi Shinazugawa\n-  The snake pillar: Iguro Obanai\n- The sound pillar: Uzui Tengen\n- The rock pillar: Gyomei Himejima\n\nI\'ll not coil too much with the characters, but I\'ll give my general opinions: 1 - Shinobu is definitely the cutest girl on all the anime (I don\'t know if this is an unpopular opinion or not), but while Nezuko is the cutest demon girl, Shinobu is the cutest standard girl or something. And again, speaking about the characters, again: I need to quote the demons (the villains). Specially about Rui, and probably the demon with tsuzumis (with drum around his body), I slightly shed some tears, but again: the story of the demo family (spider demons, Rui) just got me every time. I including identified myself with him, but again: I\'ll talk about the little life lessoes that we can take with it. The worst character is, no doubt, Kibutsuji Muzan, because you know: he\'s like a scumbag, that even kill or mistreat his followers, which is something that pains my heart (by only talking), and something that will make you hate him forever. But the characters are a very strong point on the anime (and yes: I\'ll talk about why I don\'t give a 10/10 to Kimetsu No Yaiba, on the overall section). For while, I give 9/10 to the characters: very well constructed, and you\'ll find yourself sometimes.\n\nEnjoyment: 9/10\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nSo, summingup everything I already said: Kimetsu No Yaiba is definitely a plesant surprise, coming from Ufotable (the studio that, until my brain remember, only produced some animes of Fate series). So, I think that they decided to rummage in the coffin, and finally wake up for life, with the objective of producing something that will impact the whole world (and they got it as always). Kimetsu No Yaiba is, no doubt, the best anime of 2019: something that automatically (less than 1 year) turned to an high-grossing anime: big success, and a very fast formation of a large fanbase are the characteristics of Demon\'s Slayer (or Kimetsu whatever). Anyway, definitely a must-watch anime, that I reccomend to anyone. So, you\'re probably wondering: why I gave 9/10 not 10/10? What life lessons can we take? Well, I think I didn\'t give a 10/10, because of Zenitsu. Damn,  I mean he\'s so annoying in all the senses, he yells so loudly, but he\'s funny at the same time. But I don\'t know: I didn\'t give 10/10, because I think that there was something missing to make it a 10/10, like some element, or most probably because of the ending of the last episode. And yeah. I finished the last episode of Kimetsu No Yaiba, now I\'m crazily anxious to watch the movie. Because the last episode show a very quick scene of the beginning of the movie (Infinity Train). I wish I would have luck to watch the movie on Japan, now I\'ll need to wait 5 or 6 months to launch worlwide. GODDAMIT!!!! If someone have the movie (with subtitles or not), please give to me bruh lmao. Cause I really want to watch, and yes I\'m very curious to see what will happen on the movie. DON\'T GIVE MORE SPOILERS, PLEASE!!!! I was already warned that Rengoku will die, so don\'t give more than that please. The second thing: What life lessons can we take? Well, the lesson that we need to valorize the family that we have, because seeing the entire Tanjiro\'s family (and a lot of blood around) pains me everytime, because we can predict the future, right? So, we need to valorize the family that we have (in relation to intimate relationships, and etc.), because the next day will probably be a new story (we don\'t know, right?). So, this is something that hitted me so deeply. And something very curious about Demon\'s Slayer is: we can assimilate the actual show with the actual pandemic situation, right? Like, in the both the worlds, we have a lot of people dying, and a person that don\'t give a single f*cking care to the deaths (on the kimetsu\'s world is Kibutsuji, and on the real world, are the actual f*cking stupid presidents of EUA and Brazil, right?). Take me as an example: I live in Brazil (not that surprinsgly), and this is so hard, because both kibutsuji and the actual f*cking brazilian president we have the willing to kill both of them. I know: this is very very heavy (looks heavy), but it\'s the truth. Both of them doesn\'t care about the actual pandemic, and they are like: f*ck the dead people. So, can you see the actual similarity? Okay, I really don\'t want to enter in political things, but this is necessary to say. So, yeah, I\'m just giving 9/10 to this show: very very amazing, it really intrigued, because I felt some things that I didn\'t feel for a very long time, and I\'m really happy that I returned to the shounen world. Can\'t wait to see the movie, because I know: with the movie, my adrenaline will go crazy too, and I definitely can\'t wait to cry on the movie theather, with the death of Rengoku (even if I know that this happens, I\'m already prepared to cry tho, I\'m gonna take some tissues to the movie theather as well). So, 9/10: amazing characters, amazing story, even if there\'s some things missing (and we have the annoying Zenitsu, that I think I can feel good without him yelling in my ear), overall: it was amazing, and it was a perfect example: of how shounen really need to be nowadays. Anyway, a pleasant surprise, that will definitely stay on my heart forever (full packing with emotions, laughs, and goosebumps as well). Thank you guys for reading until here, and have a nice day. Stay home, and stay protected from corona plsss. Bye guys!!!\n              '",Demon Slayer
Haikazan,"b'\n                this is my first review thank you for being indulgent\n\nfirst the scenario of Kimetsu no yaiba has nothing really remarkable it is in the end quite classic without big reversal of situation, nothing that makes him stand out from the lot. Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s objective changes from that of the other classic shonen, the goal of our hero being simply to find a way to retransform his sister into a human, (the one or mainly that of the other shonen neketsu is to be the strongest). The anime regularly speaks to us because/thanks to this objective of family relations and confronts several visions of the family with\n                  ...\n          that of the other characters. This is for me what makes Kimetsu no yaiba differentiates itself from other anime, personally I had never seen before a anime talked about family relations this is perhaps why it marked methe characters seem to have a very thorough development, I hope that all the characters will have the right to a development.\n\n\nNext the graphics of kimetsu no yaiba are very beautiful, (even if one could have thought that ufotable would have done better). The animation is just sublime, (probably one of the most animated anime I have seen). The style is quite clean a kimetsu no yaiba, (despite that this style really looks like that of other ufotable anime). The touch brought to the sword technique really make the whole beautiful (like the zenitsu lightning).\n\nThe seiyuu voices are good, (I didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t really pay attention). The sound effects are also very good there is not really anything to complain about, the most important point of kimetsu no yaiba is the OST that is just amazing, (the composer being Yuki Kajiura,) all ost are a real pleasure to listen to, (my favorite being the Zen\'itsu theme). The only regret for ost is that the one that came out the most is that of the famous episode 19, which is for me far from being the best. The opening is really good (probably one of the only ones I like among those of singer Lisa, the ending is also very cool even if it is less good than the opening.\n\nThe characters are interesting, some already have a good development, to see in the sequel if the others will have one as well, but I do not think that all will have a development. The chara design is really original, the most part are very colorful with colors that I rarely see in other anime (like the yellow of Zen\'istu).\n\nWhat I like the most about this anime is really the ost, (Yuki Kajiura being probably my favorite composer it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s pretty logical). The animations are also really sublime (episode 19) the graphic quality is really beautiful, there is no personal that is zero they are all interesting, and brings all something to the anime is contributing to make Kimetsu no yaiba one of my favorite anime (shinobu <3).\nHowever the scenario is not really transcendent, of the story in itself also it is in the final quite classical, the world of kimetsu no yaiba is really cliche, (people who fight with sabres and ""powers"" that make (almost), that fighting really reminds me of my opinion about anime before I start looking at it. (And this image is according to it\'s probably in the worst that we can give to anime in my opinion). And this is probably the image that people who do not watch anime have anime\n\nTo conclude Kimetsu no yaiba is not good because the scenario is good, Kimetsu has made talk of him because it is pleasant to watch the animations are probably the best that have seen him for a shonen neketsu the ost are sublime is this is what makes us go into the anime (the animation and the ost allowed me to see the most epic anime I have ever seen)\n              '",Demon Slayer
FaxTuaL,"b""\n                Demon Slayer is the most overhyped piece of garbage to have ever been created , it does absolutely new , it is just recycling the generic shonen garbage formula.\n\nThe only reason and I MEAN THE ONLY REASON why people dickride this series so much is because of the animation and if i'm being completely honest it isn't even all that great. \n\nSafe to say that this series has the most toxic fanbase , they have the mental capacity of a fucking peanut , giving undeserved hype to trash episodes\n\nThe story is predictable and corny , it follows a boy who wants to turn his sister\n                  ...\n          back into a human even though she is a demon she still retains her human personality thanks to the power of plot and if things couldn't get any worse a DEMON SLAYER let her go and told her brother to go to a man that will train him to become a demon slayer , like this whole story is so forced and contrived , Nothing makes  sense \n\nTanjiro isn't even a swordsman , he's just a guy who carries a sword  , whenever he's in a fight there is no strategy or skill required to win , he just spams his random ass breathing powers \n\nThe side characters also are just bland and one-dimensional , there is nothing complex about them , they're just there to fill up space\n\nThe fact that a series that does absolutely nothing or unique receives so much hype really shows the decay of the anime community , the toxic demographic of this series constantly look for ways to suck it off by comparing it to trash series like MHA , Black Clover , Boruto etc just makes no sense .

Bloooop,"b""\n                Phew. Just finished watching the 19th episode and boy was I impressed. \n\nWhen I began watching the show I had low expectations since it gave me the average sword man anime feel. The beginning was kind of slow and the show changes a lot after Tanjiro sets on his journey. For the better of course.\n\nI always enjoy when characters struggle and overcome their fears and weaknesses, and this show is filled with that. The characters are mostly likeable but I didn't really like them being used for a comedic effect in the middle parts.\n\nHowever this is redeemed later on with the characters becoming more in\n                  ...\n          depth and developing in the story. \n\nI love all of the action scenes, even though they follow roughly the same premise. \nIn those action scenes the art and animation really get you feel to for the characters and make you cheer for them. \nI also love how the attacks have an impact in every fight. With this I mean how good the sound design and animation empower the attacks. \n\nTalking about sound, the soundtrack and music direction is fantastic.\n\nNezuko is the only character I don't really like and she gives me some sister anime vibes. \n\nOverall a great anime. There are countless emotional scenes and they really nail the character development. Hoping for a season 2.\n              """,Demon Slayer

By just grabbing an image from any search engine about the hero\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s journey will provide a good road map of where the show will go. As the show follows a young man named Tanjirou living a normal in the woods with his family. However one day when he returns home he finds his family slaughtered and the only survivor being her sister, Nezuko, who became a demon. Despite being a demon she still retains some of her humanity that stops her from attacking her brother, and it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s that humanity that gives Tanjirou hope that he can cure his sister which becomes his call to adventure. He is given supernatural aid by a man who is in the Demon Slayer corps who is initially met with hostility as he tries to kill Nezuko, but then relents due to Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s perseverance and gives them a chance by directing them to a man who can help them. As they go to meet the man they are faced with a moment where Tanjirou refuses the call, because in order to continue the adventure he must become a demon slayer. This becomes a problem due to Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s nature as he finds it difficult to kill another being, even if they are a demon, nonetheless he decides to join for his sister's sake. The man they were meant to meet becomes the mentor figure for Tanjirou and puts him through many trials and training in order to prepare him for his adventure. With the Selection exam finally allowing him to cross the threshold and become a demon slayer, allowing him to journey deeper into the supernatural world. And that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s all the narrow examination i\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m going to do as the point has hopefully been made, which leads to the grander narrative.\n\nDespite following the classic hero\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s journey story, Demon slayer is still a Shounen Manga and like most shounen manga it is long running. Demon Slayer is in the more moderately long side when compared to other manga in it's demographic, and it's only halfway through the first triple digit of chapters. With such a long form of storytelling in order to not stagnate to long on a certain point in the journey, stories such as these tend to do repeat certain points of the journey again in a different form or adding new parts that they didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t use before. It makes the journey less of a complete circle but more so arcs of varying degrees. Story arcs that have as well been a main aspect of many long formed series especially in shounen series. Demon slayer for the most part has two major arcs. The first one stretching from episodes 1 through 10, and the second arc for the remainder of the season with a bit of the 3 arc at the tail end. While having story arcs aren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t a bad thing in capable hands, they sometimes tend to feel disjointed with the tiniest threads connecting them together or worse, being detours and a waste of time if they offer nothing of substance. Demon Slayer does fall into one of these categories, but luckily it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s more the former than the latter. Thanks to the magical bird of plot convenience taking them not only from one arc to the next, but also from one location to the next. With each one conveniently being more tied to the plot then the next. Anything else about the story is standard action shounen fare with a couple of hiccups. It has an evil group/organization with a x group of members that are fought in more or less ascending orders, It has a group of well trained warriors who help the protagonist along the way, and so on and so forth. None of it helps or hinder the show, which is something I can't say for the characters.\n\nTanjirou basically carries this show for most of the season. He serves as a good main protagonist for the show and is better than most shounen oriented protagonists in general. He still shares traits with many of them by being a bit loud and hot headed, but it doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t come as annoying due to it not being his defining characteristic. The same goes for his intelligence as he isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t portrayed as too smart where he over analyzes everything but he isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t dumb back of rocks either. What defines him the most is his level of compassion towards others, even his enemy. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s still able to fight and kill demons like any slayer but that doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t stop him from feeling sorry about them, which is usually missed by other slayers. Tanjirou certainly isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t a complex, nuanced, or even iconic character, but what he does have makes him endearing. His sister Nezuko however could have used better treatment for her character. Anything that could have made her interesting is neutered. Dialogue? Put a bamboo in it. Personality and internal conflict? Hypnosis. Screen time? In the box she goes. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s truly a shame especially in the moments when the show tries to reinforce this idea of their sibling bond, but their lack of having much character dynamic holds back those moments that could have had a lot of impact. \n\nThen there is Inosuke and Zenitsu two other demon slayers that the main character meets along the way. Inosuke is a belligerent bi-shounen boar boy and is the more tolerable of the main duo mostly due to the fact that he gets some development. Going from a loud very aggressive person who does things by himself, to being less aggressive and is willing to help out with others. He also doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t scream as much, but i guess that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s due to the fact that someone squeezed his neck once really hard. Zenitsu on the other hand is harder to warm up to. He is a coward but that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not the problem but more so what branches off of it. 1st is that Zenitsu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s coward personality serves as much of the comedy for the show as he is sort of a comedic relief character but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s less funny and more annoying. 2nd is that he doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t develop much as a character or at least it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s aligned with the fact that his development is inside him the whole time and he has to go to sleep to unlock it. \n\nAs for the other characters. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to say. The other demon slayers that have any relevance are the pillars, the veteran warriors, who are like the captains and commanders you would see in other shows. They are the most tropey of all the characters but that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s mostly on their character designs and limited screen time and dialogue. The demons also get little characterization, only a tragic backstory to make them somewhat sympathetic. The only one that gets a bit more than the rest is the final antagonist of the season, but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s really not much. \n\nDemon slayer also boasts great production value all around. The soundtrack is great and it accompanies the show very well. Sporting both orchestral and traditional Japanese music that range from the slow and sad, to the loud and triumphant. And at times both intertwine to create a beautiful symphony. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s also the choral singing that brings a mysterious and supernatural feeling to the show. Not to mention the mention the abundant use wind instrument music that along with the singing compliment the show which focuses on the character having breathing control in order to fight properly. Of course some tracks do fall to the wayside,but it doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t detract from how great it is overall.The art for the show is really good with striking character designs, use of color, and thick use of lines that lends to the visual appeal. Also the fact that it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s done by ufotable that gives their shows a certain polish that adds a beautiful flare to the animation and action scenes. However it still has some moments that bother me to some extent. While it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s true that the CGI is better than most other shows due to how it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s used, it still has a few blemishes here and there. This also carries on to the metaphysical attacks that the demon slayers use with their attribute appearing from thin air. They do look great and it gives them a nice visual flair but sometimes they look weird especially with tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s water version as the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93foam\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd still lingers on screen for a bit more and just looks weird. Finally i\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not a fan of shows changing visual styles for the sake of comedy or at least very few do them right and demon slayer isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t one of them. Nonetheless, the combination of its sound and arts is a sight to behold as it sweeps you off your feet and makes it easier to forgive the bullshit power ups this show has.\n\nDemon Slayer is one of the more decent shounen oriented series to come out in a while. While it does play safe in terms of storytelling, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s still serviceable for the average viewer. I just wished it was as beautifully done to the same level as the visuals and audio of the show. This is a show that I would happily like to see a continuation of, with the hopes of improvement. Maybe then the show can ascend to greatness that the show wants to be.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Humabon,"b'\n                In the past 5 months, I paused from watching anime and reading manga. Kimetsu no Yaiba meme flooded my newsfeed those days and it was indeed a struggle to avoid spoilers. Thankfully, I have teaching preparation and research to distract me from renewing my full-pledged otaku status.\n\nAnyways, many weabs dub Kimetsu no Yaiba as ""Anime of the Year of 2019"". After watching, I would like to echo the words of a friend who said, ""It\'s more like the \'animation\' of the year."". \n\nBasing from the Fate Stay Night franchise, Ufotable has a solid track record of slugfest on-the-edge-of-your-seat animations. Ufotable studio delivers the same top-notch\n                  ...\n          quality in Kimetsu no Yaiba, including the art style wherein their trademark lunar antics consume much of the screen time. \xc3\xb0\xc5\xb8\xcb\x9c\xe2\x80\x9a\n\nThe story is alright. It\'s not bad; it\'s okay. It is a typical shonen anime where the main protagonist has a protagonist trait. I mean, all throughout the episodes, Tanjiro screams to the audience ""Hey guys! I have ENFJ qualities."". The female lead, Nezuko, is the lovely object in the franchise who works like a charm because it\'s not anime without a kawaii element. As usual, the sidekicks -- Zenitsu and Inouske -- are stupid in their own way. My favorite character, so far, is Shinobu. #YandereIsLove \xc3\xb0\xc5\xb8\xcb\x9c\xef\xbf\xbd Towards the end of the series, following the trend of many shonen pilot seasons, Tanjiro slowly established his harem and we do hope that his keen sense of smell will not make him as dense as Ash of Pokemon or Asta of Black Clover. The demon-versus-demon-slayers universe was also clearly set up, in the end, leaving some mysteries with a cliffhanger that builds the hype of a possible next season(s).\n\nTo sum up, Kimetsu no Yaiba is a lovely ride. Maybe not that great compared to many anime of higher taste, but it was indeed a perfect reentry portal for fans who took a break from watching this type of entertainment. Should I read the manga now? Nah, I don\'t think so. The animation is so great -- at par with AOT or Gintama -- that I want to save the surprise in video format. Surely, this is something I will recommend.\n              '",Demon Slayer
KnightSirius,"b'\n                ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTL;DR Review\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShow starts off quite strong, 10 solid episodes. Then falls flat when it take a sharp turn and introduces an incredibly poorly written character that subsequently ruins the entire tone the show has set up until then. \n\nFurthermore, after this point it becomes quite apparent that it\'s just another flashy shounen using the same generic formula of 2-3 episodes of being assigned and completing a task, followed by a rest episode and then rinse and repeat. \n\nAll the while running into having awful power spiking issues at each new encounter due the purposefully obscured abilities of the characters used to force tiresome \'Deus Ex\n                  ...\n          Machina\' plot devices.\n\nMuch wasted potential, and extremely overrated.\nHowever, beautiful animation, and sound design as expected of a Ufotable production.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDetailed Review\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba has an extremely strong opening half. 10 solid episodes that had my hopes high that I\'d found another potential masterpiece of a story.\n\nI was certain this anime was going to be a beautifully dark-themed mash-up of \'The Witcher\' books/games but set in a historical era of Japan with a sort of wandering narrative like \'Mushi-Shi\'.\n\nThe beautiful imagery of early Taish\xc3\x85\xef\xbf\xbd era Japan, the Witcher-School like Demon Slayer Corps that takes on only the strongest Young boys turning them into monster killers, and the quickly introduced theme that not all Demons are monsters; Quickly sets the stage for an epic yet tragic tale.\n\nI expected a story showing the difficult and grim path our MC Tenjiro must follow to to take revenge on the demon that butchered his family and turned his sister into a monster. It was certainly going down that route, until episode 11 when things suddenly took a sharp turn.\n\nWell actually there are bits that did leave a bit of a foul taste in my mouth before this and immediately made it impossible to achieve >9. That being why does Tenjiro have this incredibly powerful sense of smell? Apparently we\'re expected to just accept this as the way things are. Also why does the Demon Slayer in episode 1 not simply ignore Tenjiro and fulfill his task of slaying her? This is illogical from his point of view.\n\nThat aside back to Episode 11!\n\nEpisode 11 introduces Zenitsu a frustratingly annoying character that uses a very poorly written version of the \'idiot savant\' trope with a heaping spoonful of the \'overbearing flirt\' trope. Think Brock from Pokemon. His scenes consist of him being frightened and screaming or acting like a fool and drooling over Demon-Sis. It\'s an extremely distasteful and poor attempt to forcefully inject humour, and honestly a completely unnecessary one as the show had a good balance of humorous moments prior to his introduction.\n\nMany fans say his character improves with time, but from what I could find out it doesn\'t and it\'s usually those who read the manga first who say this, as in the manga he isn\'t able to be as obnoxious because he can only violate you so much in that form whereas in the anime he can violate your eyes and ears! Delightful.\n\nThis character is so abrasive and grating to watch he alone nearly turned me off from continuing.\n\nAnd... I made it to episode 15. This is the point where I realized this is actually just another mediocre but flashy shounen.\n\nMy bet is the show is going to continue giving these demon slaying tasks that\'ll take 2-3 episodes each, and the group is going to move around and complete these with an occasional rest episode in between. The season will end with some sort of cliffhanger regarding vital information to his goal and will pick up next season to continue the pattern. Whether that turns out to be true or not isn\'t really of consequence because that isn\'t my main issue.\n\nThe formula is nothing unique, new, or exciting. \n\nHowever, besides it being an overused formula. \nThe main problem I have is these ""newbie"" Demon Slayers seem to crush every demon they come across with relative ease, using self-produced \'Deus Ex Machina\' plot devices related to their \'special techniques\' that are much closer to just straight up magic than it is to actual human abilities; Which I wouldn\'t have a problem with if they were explained adequately and they had actual limitations.\n\nThen as soon as you believe there is a limitation to their powers they simply take two separate techniques and combine them to make an even more powerful move! or better yet just give themselves an internal monologue pep talk up until they they can beat their foe!\n\nWhich is incredibly disappointing, because I didn\'t think it would end up like that seeing as at the beginning of the anime Tanjiro showed his excellent mind for strategy and battle analysis when facing Giyu; using his wits to attempt to defeat him knowing he stood no chance in actual combat.\n\nIf instead of just doing a 2 year training montage and instantly powering up the MC to master level swordsman in all but rank (which already pushed the limits of my suspension of disbelief). If they had him learn the basics for 2 years but only learn the special techniques over his journey gathering information; such as giving him some sort of ability to absorb the demons blood techniques and use them himself to a lesser effect. Say his black Nichirin blade for instance could have this power. It\'d provide for a more gradual curve in which he gained strength and it\'d be a lot more interesting to watch, especially if battles were made to rely on formulating plausible tactics to defeat the enemy rather than just bursting them down with whatever technique fits the scenario. Also limiting secondary characters techniques to 1 or 2 at most while being much less powerful and more tactically useful rather than again just more burst options.\n\nThis would solve both the issue of the inexplicable power spiking at each new foe encounter despite being the lowest ranked demon slayers, and would ground the series closer to reality because his powers and limitations would be known by the viewer and when he used a technique to defeat something it would feel less like a \'Deus Ex Machina\' element and more like just the MC simply fighting tactically with his available tools.\n\nAs for Zenitsu, either ditch his poorly written \'idiot savant\' trope or the whole character. He is irredeemable in his current state, his personality isn\'t amusing or relatable. If instead they gave him a character arc that focused on his lack of self-confidence and overcoming it; It\'d make sense, and be relatable. And his constant shouting and hyper exaggerated fear isn\'t amusing either it just detracts from the feel of what should be tense scenes.\n\nI\'m so frustrated writing this review, because this anime had such great potential to be a truly incredible story but it fell flat after setting up an otherwise quite interesting world.\n              '",Demon Slayer
BabyGirl06301,"b'\n                Best anime in its genre? Too hyped up for the quality it brings? Find out today\'s episode of ""I have no clue how to review this anime!""\n\nSo, Demon Slayer has confounded me. Here\'s the easy things to talk about: art, sound, humor, characters. The art is probably the nicest I\'ve seen come out of ufotable. So, to say that about a studio that is known for their gorgeous art and animation, that\'s saying something. This time, ufotable didn\'t shove CGI down my throat, and I thought it came across a lot nicer than previous works of theirs. The soundtrack didn\'t wow me, though. At least,\n                  ...\n          it didn\'t catch my attention. \n\nThe humor of this anime is something really unique. Most anime that have really good comedy have really good comedy because it creates its own tone within the anime. For example, when Naruto does comedy, it\'s like its own entity within the anime. Demon Slayer, though, didn\'t have that. It felt almost blended within the tone of the rest of the anime. Normally, the humor would get lost, but in Demon Slayer it doesn\'t. In fact, it kind of makes it more enjoyable. The characters are easy to talk about simply because they\'re easy to watch. I\'m talking more about personality than character development here because it\'d be easier for me to talk about that with the story, but the characters are written in a way that I didn\'t really need to think about why I liked their personalities--I just knew I did.\n\nWhich is kind of how I felt about the story. This is the complicated bit, though, because Demon Slayer simultaneously made me feel like I wasn\'t invested in the story enough to obsess over it but at the same time made me feel like the story was really good. The pacing really messed with me. The pacing in Demon Slayer, for all intents and purposes, should have made this anime suck. Fast pacing in a shounen like this, that benefits from slow training sessions and digging down deep into the characters, would normally mean death for the quality of the story. I still haven\'t been able to wrap my mind around why it works in Demon Slayer. Don\'t get me wrong--I can absolutely tell that the story would benefit from a pace similar to that of Boku no Hero Academia, but it also isn\'t being harmed by the pacing it has. In fact, the pacing works really well. It\'s not the only pacing that could work, and not even the best, but it works.\n\nNow, the development of the story and the characters is probably why I rated this nine and not a ten. Yes, the pacing didn\'t make the story worse, but the lack of richness in world-building made it impossible for me to get excited about the character developments. For example, you have Bleach that shows Ichigo\'s development as a Shinigami throughout the run of the anime, right? But the reason Ichigo developing was interesting to watch, and the reason we knew that he had become one of the most powerful Shinigami, was because we knew two things: a.) the world built up in Bleach meant that the things that Ichigo could do either signified that he was close to the top in terms of power or that he achieved power that no one had ever achieved before and b.) the characters around him got built up with power levels that Ichigo constantly got compared to and which he constantly exceeded. \n\nDemon Slayer didn\'t do that for Tanjiro. His training happens in such a short span of time that the abilities he gains, while we know they are intellectually, don\'t feel special in any type of way. That hindered my impression of his abilities later on. If he is supposed to be special, and his sister is supposed to be special, how am I to feel that that is truly the case when I don\'t know what is normal or what is powerful already? So that put a bit of a damper on things, but again, I still enjoyed it a lot. Had the world-building been done slower, I may have obsessed and theorized about it like I did with Naruto or Bleach or Boku no Hero, but I enjoyed it almost as much even though it\'s not going to take up that much space in my brain.\n\nI don\'t know if that is a credit to the writing or a detriment. It used its elements well, but it didn\'t use the best elements. The story has me interested enough to want to know what happens next, but not interested enough to agonize while waiting for the next installment. Does that mean it\'s a good shounen that made itself good without taking up 300+ episodes? Does that mean it\'s not as good as it should be? Does that mean it\'s bad for not taking the proper time to develop? I don\'t know. What I do know is that Demon Slayer is absolutely worth the watch. It may not have picked the best answer to the question, but it also doesn\'t feel like it\'s missing anything. It\'s perfect for what it is. I stand behind my score, so if you\'re curious about watching this, I recommend it completely.\n\nAnd also I am pretty pumped for what\'s next.\n              '",Demon Slayer

fushigore,"b""\n                {SOME SPOILERS MAY BE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW}\n\n\n\nI found this anime, and got interested because of the title, and added it to my very long list of anime's I should watch. After some time, I had finally finished those anime's and Kimetsu No Yaiba was left. So I watched it, after the first episode, I was already obsessed. The storyline, the characters, the animation was all up to my standards! \n\nTanjirou is the kind of protagonist we see in almost every single shounen anime, instead of being an annoying one, he sets the standards up to where we all love and adore him, he has\n                  ...\n          his sister Nezuko to help and fight alongside him, and unlike most other anime's he doesn't want to be the greatest demon slayer, nor had dreams of becoming one, but all he wants to do is become strong enough to protect Nezuko in hopes of finding a cure to turn her back in to a human. \n\nI also love the other characters like Zenitsu and Inosuke. Zenitsu may be whiny and annoying at times, but is the main comic reliefs and loveable at times, and surprises us all when we find out his true power.\n\nInosuke. I have to admit, I didn't really like him at the start because of how big of a jerk he was, but over the time, he had quite the character development. From being a self absorbed jerk to a sort of tsundere, especially when he finally realises the fact that he indeed is not stronger than Tanirou. Instead of having a breakdown and hating Tanjirou, he accepts it.\n\nOverall, I love this anime and it is now one of my favourites. I highly recommend it, but I have to admit, the gore will be quite disturbing to some viewers, so watch out for that.\n              """,Demon Slayer
pengionn,"b""\n                I started out really wanting to enjoy this show, but like many here, couldn't make it past episode 9-10ish before I just couldn't take it any more. The art is great, the fights more or less spectacular, but tragically, the characters and story are less exciting than the bowl of left-over white rice that's been in your fridge for the past 4 days. For me that's a no-go.\n\nTruth is, there is just nothing at stake in this show. Nothing. For some people that's obviously fine given the popularity of this show, but if you care about depth and are not a big fan of the\n                  ...\n          morally black and white cookie-cutter story line where the good guy always wins, save yourself the time and watch something else. Again, all of this could have been palatable with some decent character development, but at least until episode 10, nothing of the sort was anywhere to be found.\n\nFor me, the specific trigger to stop watching was the proper introduction of the blond haired guy (I've banished his name from memory) and the accompanying migraine headaches of listening to his non-stop shouting.

i_have_scurvy,"b'\n                When it comes to strong start and being dragged right into the story, this anime easily sits at the top. Starting of with some beautiful artwork and goes straight to the action involving the main characters so you want to continue to see how it plays out, the consequences are what builds the story of the anime so you have to keep watching. The main character has a different goal than the others around him that he keeps a secret giving a perfect structure of main character.\nThe early parts keep to character, world and plot building.\n\nAs the anime continues the pacing slows down but the\n                  ...\n          plot keeps developing at a good rate and takes on a more light hearted touch which is still really enjoyable. The show adds more characters and integrates them into the plot nicely using the new characters to also world build.\n\nThis season of the anime wraps up nicely ending where it started and leading perfectly from the movie which follows this season. \n\nThe Story is simple ""protect the cute girl"". But seriously the main character is invested himself because of his sister (you are invested causes she is cute). Which I feels different from other Shounen because the main character isn\'t driven by wanting to become the best but for an active family bond that we see grow throughout the anime which is a lot more relatable. 8/10\n\nOH MY GHAD ufotable what is this? This is not longer animation this is an Edo period masterpiece. The Art work is fantastic it has got crisp drawings with I will say the best by very very far colour palette. The contrasting colours the flowing liquid-like animation is perfection.  From the studio that brought you Kara no Kyoukai the blend between animation and CGI is the best ever to hit the stage. The dynamic scene blow any and very other anime out the water, they fit the actions scenes perfectly and there has never been a better fix and I will say a long time before we see such wonderful artwork and CG crossover again(although the movie has yet to come out). 10/10\n\nSound is secretly one the best things this anime has to offer. The breathing, the gentle snow crunch, the rolling water and flicking flames in pull you in the world, even if don\'t want to be there. The soundtrack is one of the memorable out there ever scene and piece are meant to be together. There are very notable names in voice actors that really bring there characters to life. 10/10\n\nEvery Character in this anime is extremely developed each of the main case with their own little back story and it reflects their personalities so well, the way they interact with each other keeps the show well ground considering how intense the characters and their personalities and experiences can make the show at times. (also cute sister) 8/10\n\nAn Enjoyable show all together I wasn\'t expecting to be dragged into this anime so much and I just couldn\'t stop watching, I loved the characters and the story which worked together perfectly and complemented by beautiful artwork and sound makes it extremely good fun to watch. 8/10\n\nOverall there is no way this anime isn\'t one the best upcoming anime series\' it\'s few flaws can be easily overlooked by it\'s overwhelming amount of strengths. I thought hard is this an 8 or a 9. Is it really up there with ""your name"", ""Sound Euphonium"" or ""Angle Beats"" and I have decided it is. This season was fantastic and well deserving of a 9/10\n              '",Demon Slayer

Kimetsu no Yaiba or The Demon Slayer, took the\n                  ...\n          shounen world by storm this season and shounen trash fans out there just can\'t wait to take more hits from this addictive drug of an anime. Just to put it in perspective, if Naruto and DBZ was heroin, SnK and OPM was codeine, BNHA and MP100 was fentanyl, then Kimetsu no Yaiba by studio Ufotable is definitely carfentanil. That\'s how potent and addictive of a series this show just is. It follows the shounen formula perfectly but just executes it at a breathtaking level through their beautiful eye-jizzing animation and pleasing eargasmic OST. This anime has the potential to be anime of the year so let\'s take a closer dive to see what sets it apart, why you should watch this & whether it really is deserving to be the anime of this year! \n\n""I swear your big brother will save you no matter what"" - Tanjiro Kamado\n\nFrom a story perspective, Kimetsu no Yaiba is very simple with a clear end goal. Almost all shounen anime tend to have such a trait and as well all know it\'s all about the journey not the destination. The show starts off with Tanjiro\'s family getting brutally murdered by demons and the only surviving member is his little sister, Nezuko, sadly turning into one. So Tanjiro must go out on a hero\'s journey to turn her sister from a demon back to a human. To do so, he must become a demon slayer, these pseudo samurai-esque warriors that are trained by former Hashira\'s, slay demons to figure out a way to learn how to cure the demon disease. They can only be killed by sunlight or decapitation by a special sword. Early on, we learn that all demons were once a human and they became demons due to ultimate villain Mujan Kibutsuji, who is the father of all demons. He is the only one capable of turning humans into demons so the main hero, Tanjiro, must kill him to rescue humanity from the demon epidemic. Very simple structured story, not too many twists and turns. The show progresses well with its powerlevels as well. Powerlevel refers to how fast a hero gets powerful enough to beat other villains. Too fast and it becomes unbelievable, too slow it just becomes boring. However, given it\'s simplistic structure, the show did became very repetitive in the middle with the whole crow sends you on a mission, demon appears, demon gets slain. Rinse and repeat. Thankfully, due to each demon, showcasing different power, we get to see different fighting styles and see our hero learn, use and adapt the training regiment he went through to become a demon slayer. One huge positive for the show is the way it layers the story and builds the stage for the character to shine during battles through use of flashbacks to justify their actions. There are gag skits here and there that gives the viewers break from constantly being on the edge of their seat but at times it feels like they drag it on a just a bit longer than needed. Lastly, there is a precipice point in the show where till you reach it, it\'s just an average shounen anime story, and I\'m sure you know which episode I\'m referring to since it was all over youtube and twitter, but afterwards, the show really finds its footing and gives new breath to the boring monotonous story this shounen anime was turning out to be.  \n\n""Don\'t ever give up. Even if it\'s painful, even if it\'s agonizing, don\'t try to take the easy way yout.."" - Zenitsu Agatsuma\n\nNow that we have a good understanding of the story, this show would not be vastly enjoyable if it weren\'t for the characters. Seriously, each of the character in the show is very well designed and their characteristics just makes them unique from each other. From the main protagonist, Tanjiro (Naruto), who despite being a demon slayer, due to his past, empathises with each demon he kills to the peak imouto, Nezuko, she taketh headpats, she giveth headpats to the awesome quirky polar opposite side characters Zenitsu (Sakura), the sleeping giant, and Inosuke (Sasuke), the best boy/girl? This show has a dynamic cast that keeps on giving as we get to learn deeply about each of their past and the struggle it took to become who they are now. Keep in mind, this season barely scratches the surface on the complex lives of these characters and their past and in future season, definitely there is more in store for them which will make them better. Moreover, we are introduced to good and bad people from the humans and demons race and this juxtaposition shows us the cheesy reality that the real demon was inside of us all along. It is our action not our appearance that ultimately justifies who we really are as a person. Beside the philosophical tangent, the seiyuus of this show deserves a huge kudos for their work. Particularly, Natsuki Hanae, seiyuu of Tanjiro, really nailing the cries and the sobs. Clearly, having voiced Kaneki, it\'s no surprise Hanae has completely mastered the voice of suffering. \n\n\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93If you can only do one thing, hone it to perfection. Hone it to the utmost limit.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Jigoro Kuwajima\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd \n\nSo far Kimetsu no Yaiba, from a character and story perspective, hasn\'t really done something too outstanding to set itself apart from other shounen anime but given that it is studio Ufotable, master of 3D backgrounds, digital compositing and computer assisted animation, adapting this anime, fans are in for a treat. Right from episode 1, all the way to episode 26, the anime looks more polished than my future. Every panel, every fight sequence, even every little gag skits, the level of detail that goes in shows what a studio blessed with ""unlimited budget"" and key animators can do to elevate an anime. This anime in short is just painting in motion. From the build up, to juxtaposiing emotions in every frame; it is just synesthesia. They use CG to mimic complex camera motions that are impossible to hand draw so when that is translated into samurai sword fighting, It\'s like watching an work of art. Moreover, it\'s not just animation, the sound team does a phenomenal job. From the OST, to the OP & ED song by LiSA, the amount of emotions it carries just makes you sit back and wonder, what have you done this year to be deserved of such movie level budgeted works in weekly anime episodes. Seriously, even the clashing & slashing of swords in the show are clean, satisfied and outright therapeutic. To sum it up, it\'s just shounen ASMR. You can never get enough of it. \n\nI am a perfect creature that is infinitely close to perfection.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Muzan Kibutsuji\n\nOverall, Kimetsu no Yaiba will undoubtedly be one of the great shounens to come out this year. I say that knowing what an amazing experience Mob Pyscho 100 S2 was and the almost failure OPM S2 turned out to be and the epic experience S4 BNHA will become. 2019 is the year of shounen anime and Kimetsu no Yaiba does a great job establishing a good foothold in the industry for years to come. The story despite being very average almost skyrocketed in sales after its adaptation thanks to Ufotable. This isn\'t to discredit a well crafted manga Koyoharu Gotouge created but just to put in perspective how much success is dependent on the studio that adapts it. Nevertheless, the show doesn\'t have a high replay value from beginning to end but certain fight sequences has an endless replay value. Definitely worth listening to the OST of this anime on repeat and knowing what a banger the show ends on, I\'m hyped for S2 of Kimetsu no Yaiba. The best girl is Nezuko by far; SHE PROTECC SHE ATTACC BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, SHE DOESN\'T SEE HUMANS AS A SNACC; and the best boy is Zenitsu (Sorry Inosuke fans); HE CRIES, HE ALMOST DIES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, HE KILLS BAD GUYS! Regardless, viewers who love shounen anime or enjoys a dark fantasy set around the period of samurai, you should definitely give this show a watch.  Anyways, thank you for reading this review & feel free to share with me your favourite quote from the anime. Ciao. \n\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\n              '",Demon Slayer
oponent,"b'\n                One of the most popular shonen anime of this time, and also one of the best when it comes to enjoyment and entertainment.\n\nStory:\nIs nothing to write home about but it does it\'s job well, having a world full of demons making the ambience feel terrifying to live in as a villager, and even to the demon slayer corps. The anime gets this point across right on episode 1 where everything feels hopeless.\nIt can be considered as your ""typical shonen anime"" type of story, but when it\'s well done, is that even a problem? The dark fantasy aspects makes it a terrible world to live in,\n                  ...\n          and the Main Character mostly wants to get stronger by necessity rather than having the clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 ""I want to be strongest/king of the world"". It gives a message of the importance of family, protecting those who cannot, and giving thanks for the small things.\nIt does start rather slow, which can be a depriment, but it also makes sense considering that not anyone can just become a demon slayer from night to day, this is a harsh and dangerous world after all.\n\nCharacters:\nWhat makes the characters so good in Demon Slayer is not how they are individually, but how they interact with each other, the 4 main characters of Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu and Inosuke start rough but become such a wholesome group that genuinely care for each other, and their contrasting personalities makes for fun interactions. It is very easy to throw hate at the characters since the show uses a lot of ""show not tell"", and that go over the heads of viewers who already are prepared to hate on them, egarding the most complains I see for each one:\nNezuko: regarded by some as a character with ""no personality"", she\'s the one who gets the less screen time, but everytime she appears she feels a bit different, considering she doesn\'t talk, you can\'t even ""tell"" how her personality changes, but by actions alone you see her progression torwards controlling her bloodlust and protecting all humans as her family (even when they don\'t always deserve it).\nZenitsu: starts very annoying to girls, and too scared to participate in fights, making people hate on him early, but as the story progresses, even though he starts with a bad first impression, he becomes more respectful and gains more courage, which is a good development to see + he gets the some of the most hype moments on the series.\nInosuke: doesn\'t have as much development as the rest, but his competitive nature has a good contrast with the rest of the group, he does start and literally a wild animal, but he also learns empathy and teamwork, which is shown by slight hints.\nTanjiro: oh boy, the MC, people call him ""he\'s just nice"" but there\'s much else to his character. For starters, how is ""being nice"" even a complain or makes him a bad character? He is nice as a default (which is something we all should be), specially to innocent civilians and people who are also nice to him, not only that but also to demons who are after all, also a victim in this world; but at the same time he can also be mean to cruel demons, and easely call out on people who are disrespectful.\nOne of his traits I very much appreciate and is not much seen on MCs is how respectful of dead he is, being often shown burying the dead, praying and mourning for them, even when they were his opponents. He also is a hardworker, which is shown by his ""older brother"" mentality of wanting to take care of everything (also working as a moral compass to the group), and how roughed up his body and hands are. It is much more preferable to have a MC who is ""just nice"" instead of one who\'s just a jerk and/or pervert.\n\nAnimation and Sound:\nOff the charts, top of the shelf, the adaptation was very well made, ufotable is that Studio. The art style for the attacks are so beautiful and unique looking, like a painting.\nEven though this section will be short, is because I can\'t describe how this is one of the best points of the anime.\n\nConclusion:\nIt does deserve all the popularity that it gets, and as everything popular, of course it will have it\'s haters. Every anime wishes they had an adapatatio as good as this one, and the one that gets it will also get the envious eyes. Unlike many other animes that go around with the same level of popularity, this is one that doesn\'t rely on sex appeal like many others, and tries to tell a humble story, with a humble MC, in a humble world, coming from a genuine place. It is considered just a ""shonen anime"" but people who actively dislike the genre, will dislike everything in that genre regardless on how well it\'s made.\n              '",Demon Slayer
thec0re3,"b'\n                An amazing season to the start of Kimetsu no Yaiba has come to an end..and I\'m finding it hard to say goodbye honestly. From it\'s art design to the animation, you can\'t help but be mystified and blown away by its pristine presentation and I found it hard not to miss an episode as it released each week. \n\nThe story follows main protagonist Tanjiro on his journey to becoming a demon slayer. As you might have guessed, the motivations of Tanjiro are..clearly going to be obvious but this also involves his sister Nezuko, who becomes the ""wait a minute"" surprise that intrigues this very moving\n                  ...\n          plot forward. \n\nWhat makes this tale such an engaging one is the gravity of this brother/sister relationship. It especially pulled me in on gravitational level as it relates to my personal relationship of having siblings and does an exceptional job of relaying this emotion as you watch this amazing anime unfold. \n\nIt\'s hard to understate the fact that this anime does not seem to disappoint on any level. The soundtrack is just as on point as the rest of its offering and it all culminates in a must watch if this one slipped past your radar. \n\nKimetsu no Yaiba has a bright future ahead of it and if an upcoming movie is not an indication that it is already on the level of motion picture masterpiece, then I honestly don\'t know what else to tell you.\n              '",Demon Slayer

kageyamasbitch,"b""\n                I didn't want to watch this anime but did because I heard so many things about it. To be fair, I am picky about the art and Tanjiro didn't seem to be my cup of tea. Nezuko was adorable and cute tho. I stayed for the story.\n\nThe story is absolutely interesting and makes me want more! I watched it within 2 days! I have never watched any anime like this before. It seemed pretty scary, but later on, the action was cool. I loved every demon's side of the story.

But anyways I loved his caring nature. \n\nBoar head always seemed so aggressive for no reason, but he was a good friend towards the end, tho he beat up my crybaby Zenitsu. Zenitsu I swear is bipolar, but he is pretty cool. Tomioka seemed like a hero and I really like him. SABITO BROKE MY HEART! I truly loved his character when I first saw him and thought he was cool. \n\nI always got emotional and this series had the perfect balance of tears and action. There weren't too many funny scenes, but I still enjoyed it. I always had to keep watching one ep after the other because it was so good! NEVER SKIPPED THE OP until things got so interesting i couldn't wait to see what happened.\n\n I recommend you watch this by yourself bc you will ugly cry. Some demons are scary tho.\n              """,Demon Slayer
KirbyWurby,"b""\n                I should literally be giving this show a 9 or 10 rating but I'll explain why not in a bit. \nThis show at first didn't look very exciting, typical hyped new show...damn was i wrong. Off the bat the shows hits you with deep feels, some great combat and a good sense of what you can expect. The story literally puts you in an emotional ride, seeing both the struggle of the main and those before him. \nCombat is great, alot of neat and omg moments, and we get one of animes cutest character. Now THE MAIN REASON WHY I GAVE IT A LOW SCORE...\nWe\n                  ...\n          are introduced to one of the most annoying, stupidest support character thus far. For a show about literally survival of the strongest and power beyond those of demons...why is Zenitsu here??? \nI really hate shows that contradict what one must be, you have those that are strong, mean yet mysterious, calm yet deadly...then you get this...personally i despise it, was bloody tough jus getting through the show without me dropping it. Really wish they drop that trend and not put annoying supports there...again just my opinion. Great show thhough.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Meelis13,"b'\n                Every now and then you get anime that just raises standards for everything. Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) is most certainly one of those.\n\nStory:\nStory shines trough and trough. I find it remarkable, how well paced it was, while not feeling slow or fast, while still giving extreme details and well delivered story all around. Even last arc of season 1 (at time of writing, anime movie is announced, but it better have season 2), which lacked fights had plenty to keep viewers interested and wanting for more.\n\nCharacters:\nAgain, extremely detailed characters. What is remarkable is how demon slayer presents the fact that demons have supernatural abilities\n                  ...\n          and demon slayers only have comparable levels after extremely intensive training. All characters feel natural, even demons, with all having their own motives, fears, hopes- full blown characters and they all have depth. While main characters stick mainly with their personas, they still feel natural and not tropey- which is very hard to write.\n\nVisuals and animation:\nWhile everything else with this show is fantastic, then visuals are out of this world. Ufotable really outdid themselves with this absolute masterpiece. There is certain combat scene that just makes jaw drop so hard its hard to pick it back up- and thats on top of already fantastic combat scenes.\n\nSound:\nWhat else can i say, but fantastic all around! From OP to ED to voice acting and in-episode music, you can tell everyone gave it their all!\n\nSummary:\nWell, what else can i say that this is new top anime. And its going to be very hard to beat!

K1ngOfSloth,"b""\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba already is THE Anime 2019 for me. \nIt got an amazing story. It got overwhelmingly beautiful artwork. The music is just wonderful, it tears me up. The characters are all, well most of them, very likeable and I couldn't help but giving this the top spot in my favorite anime.\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba's story isn't completed yet. There's much more to come and look forward to. It pains me that I read the manga tbh because I'm not able to enjoy all what's to come with the beautiful animations blind. But I still enjoyed it.\n\nArt and Sound are so amazing, creating such an\n                  ...\n          amazing atmosphere, it's unbelievable. The animations, especially in fights when they use their breaths, are the most beautiful drawings I've ever seen. I get eye- and eargasm everytime I see and hear the opening alone.\n\nAnd on top of that the characters are all epic as hell. Ofc not all are unique and special and simply the best, but they are great nevertheless. There are some very unique ones tho and basically everyone has some kind of deep backstory. \nI have to say that I found some characters in the anime pretty annoying, I started reading the manga after ep 25 and got to love most of the chars I disliked in the anime, but have to mention that I disliked some by 'anime only'.\n\nThey also juggled between Action and Comedy pretty well and I would say the comedy is, even if not the best, really good. It's not comedy focused anyways but still gets you laughing everytime\n\nNothing but a 10/10 from me.

I like the fast pacing in this anime, just 5 episodes and so much has happened, can't wait for more. \n\nThe art style is just so cool and it seems fitting for the genre. Sometimes it's shocking while the other times it's so wholesome.

The awesome characters are all very likable and you will find yourself cheering for them.\n\nThis is why I gave it a 9\n(keep in mind that this is my opinion and you might think about this anime different than I do so don't be mad, please. \nAlso, don't watch the anime just because a random guy on mal thinks it's a good anime)\n              """,Demon Slayer
BeepNeep,"b""\n                Felt like they used AI to create the most predictable story any anime could have. This show is what I assume non-anime watchers think all anime is like, so they just avoid it.  Nothing really unique or special about the show, but the art style is nice. I like the look of the characters but they were all stereotypes I've seen too much. They react in the exact way you could expect and aren't very unique in personality. I think young people might like this show, but for something with sustenance, look somewhere else. The show isn't bad, but it's not good. \n              """,Demon Slayer
2U62W4N6,"b'\n                This is a standard Shonen anime, embellished with sleek visuals.\n\nThe narrative is overly cautious and underperforms in numerous areas, exhibiting a linear moral perspective among its characters that is too simplistic. The dialogues operate on a surface level, merely echoing conventional Shonen ethics without delving into deeper layers. The show-runners seem to underestimate their audience\'s capacity for subtle understanding, providing little room for the ""show, don\'t tell"" approach to storytelling. This issue, compounded by an over-reliance on repetitive plot devices such as flashbacks, disrupts the rhythm and pace of many events, resulting in a narrative that feels stretched out and hard to endure between the\n                  ...\n          visually appealing sequences.\n\nHowever, the anime does have redeeming qualities. It dedicates time to the careful unravelling of its story, ensuring it never feels too taxing or overwhelming. The clarity with which the storyline is presented is commendable, although this is often due to repetitive sequences and the protagonist\'s ever-present inner monologues, which comment on almost everything for the audience that is already visible on screen.\n              '",Demon Slayer
Johnathaj,"b'\n                I was very happy to see that the one-star option used the word ""appalling"" as the adjective. I was concerned that the star rating would not be able to portray my deep, deep hatred for this show, but I see these fears were unfounded. This show has very good animation. I wish it was attached not to this ass-fucked, god-shitted, show.\n\nThe fightscenes are very boring. If you look past the nice animation, they\'re all very simple beyond their gimmicks. The fight with the drum guy was interesting, but they just sat in that room as it rotated around. The fight with the ball woman: they\n                  ...\n          just jump around in the backyard while the woman throws balls at them. It looks pretty, but it\'s like a moldy peach. You bite into it and it\'s fucking disgusting. (Also I hate peaches as a fruit in general). The fight with Akaza is just them punching and hitting each other on the side of the train tracks. The train guy was gross he turned into this nasty train worm and it was just nasty. And then he died instantly. Because tanjiro is amazing and strong and we love him so so much because he is the protagonist and is very very powerful. I guess I\'m getting into another problem. Tanjiro reminds me of wheat thins. He is SUCH a nice person guys. HE IS SO KIND. It\'s boring. He\'s just like every other protagonist. He is perfect in every way. Then he starts crying about his sock puppet family (sock puppets because they have no personality; more on this in the next paragraph). Then he is instantly fine. They need to make up their mind, happy and then crying. I get whiplash.\n\nThe characters are very one-dimensional. Tanjiro\'s family gets killed off so fast I am not sure why we are supposed to care. When they tried to do that sad flashback in the movie I laughed. Was I supposed to feel sad? Sad that these pictures died and now this other picture is sad? No. Because these characters are so one dimensional they are just pictures. Of course then we go to the boring boring training montage where tanjiro runs through the forest over and over again and then whatever he goes off and does some shit I don\'t remember. Zenitsu would be interesting if his ""sad"" past of not being good at anything was not a complete joke to everyone. The little sister girl. ... what\'s her name ... oh right nezuko. She does not speak. She spends most of her time in a box. Buy a stuffed animal of her and you can feel like she is there in the flesh because she has the personality. of a inanimate object. Let\'s see. Who else is there. There\'s the pig guy I don\'t remember his name he\'s angry or something and that\'s it. It\'s funny I guess but there is no substance. Ok who\'s next. The chicken man. The flames on his coat look like the flames I used to draw on paper airplanes in first grade so they would look cool. He never blinks and is too cheerful I dislike it I was happy when he finally died. Especially since he was alive for one movie. Was I supposed to care? That they introduced this one-note character and then killed him? It was cheap. Let\'s see, the bug woman. I like her. She\'s funny. Moving on. The other characters don\'t really matter. Who else is there? I don\'t remember.\n\nThe animation is very good. But that makes me hate this show more. There is no plot, they just have a bunch of separate events strung together, reminds me of spongebob. I know that\'s a narrative strategy, but since there\'s little worldbuilding around the larger society beyond the demon slayers, the sporadic plot makes it feel like an empty story. Everything is shit. I fucking hate it. (Except, of course, the animation, the music, and the bug woman). I made this account just so I could shit on it. I struggled to write this review. It was immensely difficult. I can barely remember the show. It was barely memorable. It astounds me that this show is popular. It fucking astounds me.\n              '",Demon Slayer
darkos88,"b""\n                Honestly, I don't like horror and bloody genres. But with the exception of this anime, even though it's a bit disgusted, the story is really good. Moreover, the animation is really top, there's no match. I think again this is just season 1, it's already perfect like this, especially season 2 is even crazier for sure. It's true that anime doesn't choose the wrong studio, ufotable is the best. The music is also very perfect, it really fits the story well, the singing voice is also very good. From the initial episode, I really enjoyed watching, I honestly watched eps 1 at night, when I\n                  ...\n          found out the story was good, I stayed up late hehehe.

Icarus_6,"b""\n                *SPOILERS*\n*SPOILERS*\n*SPOILERS*\n\nI know, it may seem very hard to love such a popular anime as this but it is truly great. Tanjiro's character shines above all the rest. He has the ability to sympathize and respect his opponents. For example, when he fights the bongo demon (Sorry, I forgot his name.) He makes an effort to not step on his writing and he would compliment his bongo playing whilst the demon is dying. Another of my favorites is with the spider family, while the demon is dying, he forgives him and knows he was misunderstood. Hell, he even hugs the former human. \n\nTanjiro is a great\n                  ...\n          character and I want to see where he goes in more adventures..\n              """,Demon Slayer
mrkruzjr,"b'\n                (this is my first review here so bare with me)\nKimetsu no Yaiba isnt good. Its a cash grab for people who dont really watch anime and want to see pretty animation but nothing else. The premise is our MC, Tanjiro, experiences a terrible series of events caused by demons which result in his precious sister being turned into a demon. Now he is traveling the country with her in tow trying to figure out how to turn her back. Now this sounds interesting and sounds like a change of pace from the typical ""I want to be the best/strongest ever"" shonen anime, but is executed\n                  ...\n          poorly. VERY poorly. Without spoiling too much I will try to explain why this is the way it is. The characters have little to no development past the main character getting stronger. The episodes have about 7 minutes of actual content but then pad the rest with drawn out scenes of the characters hyping themselves up just to do one move. (Think of Goku going SSJ3 against Buu for the first time but longer and not as epic) The characters are all cut and dry copies of other characters in other shows even down to their backstories, which also dont explain how some of them are as strong as they are. On top of that its so predictable how things will turn out its almost a joke. You can honestly skip through 10 minutes of an episode and realize that nothing has changed in the episode, then they pull off the big finisher for a minute with no real change in the situation because they decided ""now im gonna do it!"" Theres no epiphany, no power up, no weakness exploit, they just do it because they decide theyre done being hit. The sisters situation is barely shown or explained after she becomes a demon. She develops powers that the other characters ""have never seen before"" then thats it. No explanation of why she is (or isnt) strong. One of the supporting characters has the most annoying situation behind him fighting that its almost insulting to watch. I would say what it is but that would probably be a spoiler. Just know that hes the nost annoying character and they change nothing about him. This show is rough. It relies on blood and pretty action scenes to keep you entertain while not giving you much of anything else. Which is disappointing because it world builds so beautifully. You see the potential of what these characters can do but they accomplish almost nothing. The fear and sense of danger they set up that ""no one is safe"" gets taken from you when the characters win just because theyre the main characters. The set up of a child being forced to grow up and quickly find the answer of how to save his sister gets taken away when youre 17 episodes in and realize they havent gotten the least bit closer to what they\'re looking for. All they get is information in one episode. The interesting (albeit annoying) side characters have no real motives to travelling with the main character. They meet up and then they just follow him just because. Im im not mistaken, he hasnt even told them what his goal is or where hes headed. I wish I could say there was some redeeming qualities about the show past the animation of fights for 3 minutes of 20, but there isnt. \n\n\nTL;DR: The show is mediocre because the characters are copy/pasted from other shows, and the story becomes predictable and develops at such a slow pace that nothing happens.\n              '",Demon Slayer
PicklePride,"b'\n                Oh my god in heaven is this show a breath of fresh air!! It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s been a long while since an anime has evoked such a unique set of emotions from me. This is a one in a million series, so let me break down what\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s so amazing about it as accurately as I can.\n\nThe characters. They are the heart and soul of Demon Slayer, and their complete lack of depth past simple caricatures is what will eventually bring you to tears. You truly feel for their sadness as well as their happiness, and you won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be able to help rooting for them as this show\n                  ...\n          shamelessly condescends to you by using cheap tactics like psychological trauma and post-mortem backstories to manipulate the target demographic into wetting their diapers. When Tanjiro makes his fifth monologue about his determination to protect his sister in the middle of what\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s supposed to be an intense action scene, you WILL feel his emotions, because the show might as well have put the words \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93FEEL THIS\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd on the screen like some kind of sitcom with a studio audience. And let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not forget the villains, whose motives and personalities don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even exist until the climax of their arc. This writing ability could only come from the most inspired of individuals. The nuance in character development truly makes me believe the author himself has an albino cannibalistic sister whom he carries around in a box to protect her from the sunlight and from people who don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t like albinos.\n\nThe story. This isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t your typical shounen plot, no sir. In what other shows can you watch a young optimistic boy lose his loved ones to evildoers then embark on a journey to seek justice while gathering strength at a pace unheard of to his teachers and peers? In what other shows will you see an older brother go to great lengths within an organization to seek a cure for his younger sibling, who also fights along his side? No others, that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s for sure. The visceral gratification you get from self-inserting as the protagonist while he excels at everything and overcomes obstacles to defeat bad guys who commit violent murders is one of the greatest feelings ever, and Demon Slayer delivers. After the first twenty expositional segments, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll be completely immersed in the story and world of Kimetsu no Yaiba.\n\nThe production. While the animation is kind of meh (it switches to CG sometimes which is just ew!), the music conveys emotion almost as poignantly as the dialogue itself. The eerie feudal-era soundscape perfectly complements the orchestra as the strings and piano whisk you away to Feels Land whenever a character\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s inner-monologue gets particularly epic. Even after finishing the show, the soundtrack sticks with you and chokes you up every time you hear it. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s how powerful it is. I think I can credit the main theme for at least ten of the dozen times I cried while watching Demon Slayer. \n\nIf I haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t already expressed how much I love this show, I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t know what else to do except watch it a hundred more times. Every smile, every tear, and every soft loli grunt is an adventure on its own. I can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t say much else about it without getting into spoilers about the amazing villain or about the greatest anime episode of all time (you know the one), so I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll just stop here. Kimetsu no Yaiba is the one thing we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve all been waiting for, and we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d be crazy not to bring it to the highest esteem. \n\nAbsolute 10/10 overall, but actually 5/10 for making me feel like as infantile and stupid as shrunken Nezuko.\n              '",Demon Slayer
katyajini,"b""\n                This show was exactly what I needed. Please be aware that there are a couple vague spoilers in my review, nothing too fancy and nothing outside the released anime. No manga spoilers. \n\nThe show, while seeming to be a pretty cookie cutter shounen, is anything but. KNY really handles grief and growth in a way that doesn't jarr the enthralling action and violence, but accompanies it, makes it interesting, long-lasting, and poignant. This is best showcased by Tanjiro. He loses his family and barely holds onto the threads of his sanity by becoming everything his family had wanted him to be--a good older brother. He\n                  ...\n          embodies this genuine kindness, this deep generosity, not only with Nezuko, but with each and every relationship he fosters. His gentle reprimands with Inosuke and Zenitsu, his appreciation for Giyuu, his consistent and unerring patience. The story becomes deeper, richer, when you consider that these may be coping mechanisms for a boy who truly has not had sufficient time to grieve the violent loss of his entire world. \n\nI enjoyed the richness of the relationships between the characters, and I think it is natural to be drawn into the sort of unconditional gentleness of a character like Tanjiro, but the show is also full of beautiful cultural elements, fantastic animation (I've never seen an anime like it--good job, Ufotable), and just a lovely mix of dark and light themes. The humor that is interspersed is welcome and is actually quite fitting. I might get hate for this, but the only character I found a little forced was maybe Zenitsu. I'm not totally sold on his character yet. \n\nI definitely look forward to seeing where this anime goes. Mugen Train, where the hell are you!!\n              """,Demon Slayer

Mrromana,"b""\n                A typical shounen anime, nothing more nothing less.\nFirst the good parts about the show:\nAmazing animation, maybe the best I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve ever seen, the fights are very well executed.\nSound track is good but nothing amazing.\nAnd that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s it basically.\nThe story starts very typically with a young protagonist whose family gets slaughtered by demons, and his sister turning into one. He now must slay all demons to avenge his family and heal his sister.\nWhat drew me into the show initially was the dark tone the show seemed to have, darker than your average shounen that is, I mean his family was killed in episode 1, and literally all the\n                  ...\n          fights are at night, so you can imagine my shock when literally 1 episode later our protagonist Tanjiro was already cracking dumb jokes. Seriously if you start watching the show from episode 2 or 3 you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d never guess this was a boy whose entire family was killed, it was such a tonal whiplash. And to make things much worse, the humor is awkward, cringy and very misplaced.\nThe characters are definitely the biggest weakness, our main boy Tanjiro is such a good natured, determined boy to the point where it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just boring and incredibly unrealistic. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93My whole family was killed by demons?

Well I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll just have to defeat literally the strongest demons in the world to heal her and end a conflict that lasted centuries all on my own, while carrying my waifu-bait sister on my back, yeah that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not impractical or stupid or endangering to her at all, I mean every time he runs into demons or demon slayers they both obviously try to kill her, but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s ok because she\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s both strong enough to face demons and composed enough to not eat humans, because yeah she was brainwashed by my new grandpa to protect humans instead of killing them, awesome!

MikhaliX,"b""\n                As of this review, I've just started episode 15.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to get this out of the way first. This review is mostly just me venting so if I'm being a little unfair to this show, that's probably the reason why.\n\nAlso, Ufotable did a great job in the art department.  This anime is a feast for the eyes. Visually, I'd easily give this anime an 8 or above rating.\n\nHere's what I do have a problem with: The direction of scenes and the characters.\n\nSo many things go into directing that it's very difficult to pin down what's exactly wrong with it but I'm\n                  ...\n          gonna' try anyway.\n\nIt feels like there are too many moments that pad out the run time. Tanjiro often just stands there in shock because he can't believe his eyes that an event is unfolding. Maybe I've just watched too many shows now but I just want it to get to the point.\n\nI'll try to be as vague as possible with the story beats that annoyed me.\n\n***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***\n\nWhen Tanjiro encounters a very important demon in public, I don't understand why he just doesn't yell out that he's a demon. Tanjiro hesitates because the demon is posing as a human and has a family with humans. If there was room for doubt that this demon might be just trying to live a normal life I can see why he hesitates but he KNOWS he's evil. The demon even slashes at a man's neck during their encounter.\n\nIt feels very annoying when the main character is the one breaking the momentum of the moment when he let that demon get away.\n\n*** END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS***\n\nIt's also the same when he encounters new friends into the party. It takes a really long time for him to explain that his sister is the demonic presence in his backpack.  Everybody is already aware that there's a demonic presence so why doesn't he just explain himself and that he's trying to find a cure?\n\nEven her reveal to the other characters (which takes a full day later) feels like time padding. It has to go through this stupid gag where someone misunderstands that they're not in an intimate relationship. I've seen my fair share of anime and I feel like a have a good sense of what comedic timing is like and this anime just does not have it.\n\nWhat might have been a funny moment outstays it's welcome with the characters screaming nonsense at each other.\n\nHere is lies the second problem. The characters.\n\nAll 3 of the male protagonists who are traveling together are just variants of screams made into characters. \n\nThere's the overly kind screaming one.\nThe cowardly screaming one.\nAnd the wild screaming one.\n\nIt's like they're trying to make up for the fact that the only girl in the party can't/won't talk at all.\n\nIt ties in with the problem with directing. I get that overreacting is a form of comedy but if the characters overreact to everything, wouldn't that just become regular old reacting?\n\nSo in the end, who could I see enjoying this anime? I think that this anime is great for young and new anime fans.\n\nFor people who've been watching for a long time, unless visuals are all you care about in an anime, this show will wear down your patience as it goes on.\n              """,Demon Slayer
FyXenovia,"b'\n                This is the type of show that I\'ll keep telling my friends to watch over and over again until they watch it. I don\'t care if they don\'t like anime or any cartoons. All I say to them is ""Watch it or regret it."" \n\nStory: (10/10)\n13 years old Tanjirou, is a kindhearted boy who lives with his family(Mother and 5 Siblings(Nezuko, Rokuta, Shigeru, Hanako, and Takeo) they make a living by selling charcoal to the Local Villages down the mountain. But one day while Tanjirou off trying sell the charcoals. Something terrible happened. On the way back Tanjirou witnessed something, possibly the worst thing could\n                  ...\n          ever happen to someone. He witnessed his mother and his 4 siblings(Rokuta, Shigeru, Hanako and Takeo) has been slaughtered. And only one survived, Nezuko. But she got turned into a demon in the process. Tanjirou joined the Demon Slayer Corps to avenge his family. And also find the way to cure his sister back to normal. The story goes from there.\n\nI just love how the story went. The fact that he\'s still strong after losing a family in the blink of an eye, at the age of 13, Is just mind-blowing. The hardship of being the oldest sibling. And trying his best for his little sister. And he also trying to be a strong brother that doesn\'t have any weaknesses, to the point he tries to hide the fact that his ribs are broken. Tanjirou is someone you want to be if this stuff happened to you.\n\nThe comedy in this anime is also something I like. I know it\'s mainly friends arguing and screaming at each other faces. But I enjoyed. I can relate to it. Me and my friend hop in the discord call and just arguing and screaming at each other. Especially about anime. It\'s just my type of humour.\n\nCharacter: (10/10)\nAs for the characters. You already can tell that Tanjirou amazing by the things I said above. \nAs for Nezuko:\nNezuko being a cute demon she is, trying her best not to do the demon things (Killing/Eating human.) At first she still confused on whats going on and attack his own brother. But as the story goes, even though there\'s rarely any word coming out of her mouth. Her character development is pretty decent. With the help of Urokodaki-san, Nezuko be able to maintain herself without consuming human flesh or do bad stuff to humans. ""Human is family and Demon are evil"" Even though that\'s what Urokodaki told her, she still doesn\'t attack a good demon. Which in my book is FANTASTIC! And the fact that Zenitsu and Inosuke bring a different side of Tanjirou. You can tell they slowly becoming a good pals. The characters development for these trio is pretty cool. I don\'t want to spoiled more about these two, so just watch it for more details.\n\nArt: (9/10)\nThe art is something new to me. The way the Water Breathing is drawn, it is definitely something I can appreciate.\nThe way the water just twirling on Tanjirou\'s blade is just. WOW. Safe to say water breathing never fail to amazed me. \n\nI can\'t talk much about the background, mainly because I don\'t paid close attention to it. Since I didn\'t complain about it and didn\'t notice anything bad. IT\'S A PASS FOR ME.\n\nMusic: (10/10)\nThe Opening, Ending and The OST is fire! With LiSa singing both Ending and Opening there\'s nothing for me to say but to put them on my playlist. As for the OST ""To Destroy the Evil"" something I frequently listened to. AND THE ALL MIGHTY ""Kamado Tanjirou no Uta"" THIS SONG IS SO GOOD!!! Even though there\'s no Full version for it yet. I\'m still jamming to it everytime. Give it a listen if you have nothing better to do.\n\nEnjoyment:(10/10)\nThroughout the whole show, I\'m either Smiling or Laughing and sometime I cried. If show can make me do these things, it\'s either I liked the show or loved it. And after watching 21 episodes of it. I can confirmed: I\'m in love with this show. The Story, Art, OP/ED, Background Music, Characters and The Animation is just something I\'m fond with. This show is REMARKABLE. You won\'t regret watching it.

Redomic,"b'\n                This series was especially conflicting for me, it has probably the best animation we\'ll ever see, but on the other hand, the show is unbearable most of the times.\n\n[Very Mild spoilers, considerably none]\n\nI\'ve had to drag myself every single time to finish an episode, and as much as I\'d like myself to enjoy this show. It\'s just God awful in every other factor apart from animation. \n\nFirst, starting with the good elements:\n\nThe Animation, done by UFOTable, is beyond God-tier. Every frame of this show is wallpaper worthy. The bold art style and the CGI fits in perfectly with my taste and is done by the\n                  ...\n          most talented people in animation. The atmosphere and the music go wonderfully with the theme of the show. Before this, I\'d consider with just those factors alone, that a series would be worth every minute. \n\nBut, and here it comes, this show is hot flaming garbage. I am somebody that enjoys mindless Shonen, even the acclaimed shitty/mediocre ones. Naruto, Dragonball, etc. Even if they\'re cliched to death, at least they bring something interesting to the table character/plot-wise. This show, on the other hand, adds absolutely nothing. It makes things worse.\n\nThis show is a step down from a shitty shonen linear story formula. Which is very hard to do. Awful comedy, cringe-inducing characters, and the worst pacing I\'ve ever witnessed. It was honestly the hardest thing to watch. It\'s sad, and all in all just plain stupid. The show is dumbed down to a point where there\'s nothing left. Watch any episode and you\'ll realize 90% of it is filler. In a 25 minute episode, almost all of it is spent on unnecessary monologues, life stories, and flashbacks. The fights, which I have to agree, are the pinnacle of Animation as of now, last at the most for 2 minutes. Even, in these 2 minutes the characters most of the time ruin it with offhand ""jokes"" and monologues. Just how much BS can you tact on a 26 episode series? It\'s painfully obvious the show is nothing more than it\'s animation.\n\nThe characters in this show are the definition of annoying and uninspired. Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke are the main characters. They\'re also the most annoying. Especially Zenitsu. His specialty is that he sleeps in the middle of his fights? sent off as a joke? Yes, a great idea. Even the side characters apart from a few are very linear and uninteresting. The demons hardly have any impact on the story. The character development is non-existent after the first 3 episodes. \n\nHonestly, If I were to go on, It\'d take me a few days to finish this. I\'d also spoil a lot, so I am going to leave it here. \n\nAll in all, I feel like the community for the show has 2 sides. They either enjoy it or absolutely hate it for the writing. Like me. This show is very much overrated, but it\'s understandable why. I just wouldn\'t, in any state of mind give this show anything above 5/10. Would be an insult to every other show rated lower. \n\nIf you\'re considering watching this. Don\'t. Just go watch the fight scenes on youtube and read the summary of the story.

LordSozin,"b""\n                - The story is average like your generall action/monster hunting anime with a theme about family bonding and etc. Nothing outstanding.\n\n- The art style is fine. Except for episode 19's Epic fight scene.\n\n-The sound is again fine. \n\n-Characters. In my opinion, the main characters are boring. None of them stand out to me. Tanjiro is just another average protagonist that wants to protect everyone, and get his sister to turn back into a human. Inosuke is a hot-headed person that tries to be cool and all but can be genuine to people around him. Zenitsu is one of those annoying protagonists that happens to be\n                  ...\n          super powerful. (Again, very mediocre). Finally, Nezuko is the main protagonist sister that happens to be very cute to grab the viewer's attention whenever she is on screen. AND She is a badass.  \n\n-My enjoyment before episode 19 was fine. I didn't like it or hate it. When Episode 19 came out, I thought I was starting to like the show. The episode had incredible music, art, fight scene and message behind it. However, after episode 19, the anime sucked (for me at least). From episode 20 to 26, all we got is a bunch of pillars and the main characters' training/recovering from episode 19 fights. It was so cheap. None of the pillars got significant screen time from those episodes. The anime even spent a whole episode on Tanjiro and Pillars talking/fighting (barely fighting) in front of Pillars's mansion! What a waste of money.\n\n- My point is that this anime does not deserve the praise its been getting. If you like this anime, good for you. If you hate it or don't like it and you think this anime is overhyped, I agree with you.\n              """,Demon Slayer
FireFlash21,"b""\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba started off on the right foot. This anime establishes a nice trajectory for the main characters and story with beautiful artwork and pacing. Right from the first 5 minutes you know what is going to happen - no spoiler - but I am fine with that because the execution works. The pacing is decent and sets up the next part of the story.\n\nThe first 6 episodes are done well and everything within this world makes sense so far. It moves at a pace that keeps us turning the page (and in this case watching the episodes). But halfway through episode 6 during\n                  ...\n          the arrow fight, it seems the writer left or something happened where everything takes a turn for the worse. The world and characters suddenly change as well as the genre. You will know mid-episode when a recap happens in the middle of a fight and then the tactics are gone, comedic parts are thrown in to be entertaining and new characters that dilute everything the story had going so far. The pacing also dies off and it felt like 5 episodes could be turned into 1 interesting one or cut altogether.\n\nIf you are watching this anime, stop at episode 6 where things are still good and wait for the remake. The story line has potential but is wasted after episode 6.\n\nOverall, the artwork is very nice, story is predictable but still executed decently and enjoyably.\n\nIf I were to give a comparison, it starts out serious like Fullmetal Alchemist and then happens to get stuck in Candyland where they get distracted and join forces with Meowth and Wobbafett. I mean they're very different of course but just giving you the heads up.\n\nBefore 6, the story is a 7, art is an 8, sound is a 7, character 7, enjoyment 8, overall, 8\nAfter 6, the story is a 3, art is an 8, sound is a 7, character 3, enjoyment 2, overall 4\n              """,Demon Slayer

Let us begin, shall we?\n\n~Story~\nDecided to watch this anime with no subtitles after taking a year of japanese in college. Couldn't really understand what was being said but the story was basic enough that i could pick up what was going on despite that. I would highly recommend watch this one with subtitles or more preferably in the English Dub as it will probably make the story easier to understand.

rtil,"b'\n                Shounen is a tried and true genre that has grown through generations of stories building off the predecessors that inspired them. For the most part, audiences and creators alike know what works and what doesn\'t by now. There are story beats, character archetypes, good-guy power-ups and bad-guy boasts that we\'ve come to expect - and it would be a mistake to think otherwise. Though these tropes are not inherently bad - they are merely another way for us to scratch our unending desire to endlessly categorize and file familiar things in media. It does not matter if the same trope is used a thousand times\n                  ...\n          in a thousand different stories - what matters is that they have a purpose, and if that purpose resonates with both the characters and the audience.\n\nDemon Slayer is not a story that takes a lot of risks. For a seasoned anime fan, Demon Slayer doesn\'t waste any time checking off every shounen trope in the book. Yet at every familiar turn, there\'s a light ahead that keeps you captive to the journey: A lingering mystery, a cliffhanger, the prelude to a thrilling battle. After coming down from those highs there are times your patience might wear thin, but then it pulls you back in again. This process can be frustrating, but despite the ups and downs that come with shounen series, the elements that Demon Slayer excels in make it easy to forgive its shortcomings. For someone new to anime, Demon Slayer would be a fortunate first entry into the world of shounen anime, with an easily digestable episode count. For anime veterans, you\'ll see echoes of characters and arcs from series past that you\'ve loved and hated, willing and reluctant at the same time to take those familiar journeys again.\n\nSTORY (6/10)\n\n+ Straightforward story with clear goals\n+ Solid setting & timepieces\n+ Compelling story arcs and worldbuilding with potential for larger stakes\n~ Power system is very simplistic, lacks logical structure\n- Tonally jarring and overbearing humor, jokes don\'t always land, some drag on too long\n- Foreshadowing could be utilized better\n\nThe story of Demon Slayer is laid out simply. Our main character Tanjirou\'s family is slaughtered by demons - save for his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon, who thirst for the blood of humans. He vows to avenge his family and to restore Nezuko\'s humanity. And so his journey begins by training to become part of the Demon Slayer Corps, to find the demon responsible for slaying his family, and for discovering how to save his sister.\n\nI would say the story of Demon Slayer is where the anime has its most glaring strengths and weaknesses. It\'s only speculation, but I believe Demon Slayer must be an ambitious learning experience for its creator, mangaka Koyoharu Gotouge, as this is their first published manga that has run for more than a single chapter. And when you look at it that way, it\'s easier to understand why Demon Slayer sometimes clumsily handles shounen pitfalls, while later handling the same scenarios better.\n\nUfotable\'s adaptation thus far has been absent of wasteful filler with brisk pacing, so this first season is packed generously with content. Because of this, I could talk about the story forever - but to keep it short I\'ll share my thoughts on some things it does well, and others it doesn\'t.\n\nAs far as strengths goes - Demon Slayer\'s world is full of compelling mysteries and conflict. It is the early 20th century in the Taisho period of Japan - while the advent of an industrialized Japan is on the horizon, the rural settings and traditional Japanese aesthetic is still dominant. And so the presence of demons plaguing their world blends perfectly with the almost mythical status of those who fight them, and the techniques and weapons they use. The story shines its brightest when the fights between humans and demons transcend beyond characters loudly announcing their next attack or technique - something that is largely trivial to the story - and instead give the audience a conflict deeper than blood and swords. While many demons that Tanjirou and his friends face end up being ""monster of the week"" fodder, we\'ll see a side of them that gives them humanity, and begins to blur the black and white line the story presents at the beginning. By the end of the first season, you really begin to question what larger meanings are stirring in the world of humans and demons, or even if they could possibly coexist. The best shounen are known for making you question what you believe to know as good and evil, and Demon Slayer begins to tap in to that, which I hope it will continue to build on in its coming seasons - and judging by the spectacular sales of the manga and the anime I have no doubt will come. Demon Slayer raises the stakes with each passing arc, and it\'s easy to see how a 2nd season could build on what the first establishes, as the true powers that be have not shown their hands yet.\n\nWhile Demon Slayer is a fairly serious story, there are plenty of moments of humor, and it felt more miss than hit here. There is a lot of yelling and screaming used to deliver comedy (more on that later), with plenty of \'reaction faces\' and chibi moments to boot. If I had to describe these moments in one word, it would be hyper. We\'re talking sugar-high, kids running around with permanent marker and no parental supervision hyper. It can clash with the tone of the episode sometimes, especially during battle scenes. Whether you enjoy this kind of humor depends on you, but how quickly you tire of it will probably depend on your age. Personally, I never laughed at any of these scenes, and many of them physically hurt me to watch as some drag on for far too long. But then there are moments when you\'re caught by surprise, and a snide offhand comment or quick visual gag will be thrown in, and make you laugh when you weren\'t expecting it. It was relieving to laugh out loud at Demon Slayer when it wanted you to, and I think the comedic timing by the animators at Ufotable helped a lot in delivering these moments. Humor can really help tie together a story with a lot of violence, tragedy and death, because you can\'t bum out your audience forever. The author certainly knows this, but are going overboard at times.\n\nYes, Demon Slayer is not without its moments of weakness - and while the story is ripe with potential and fascinating questions for the audience to ponder, it sometimes immediately smothers those opportunities. Easily the best example I can give is that at one point, a demon mentions his craving for a special kind of blood that only certain humans have. Immediately your mind starts to flood with possibilities - who has this cursed blood? Why do they have it? Why do demons want it? Well, worry not - because quite literally right after this blood is mentioned, Tanjirou\'s familiar appears out of absolutely nowhere to explain away everything about it, instantly dissolving the tension and creating a pointless distraction for an awkwardly placed bit of trivia. These are rookie story mistakes that hearken back to early days of shounen where authors couldn\'t hold back anything longer than 5 seconds, or assumed audiences wouldn\'t remember something being foreshadowed for longer than 5 seconds. It can do a story a lot of good to withhold information from the characters and the audience until a time when it needs to be known.\n\nAnd whether this is a negative or neutral point to you, it\'s important to mention this: Demon Slayer does not present its audience a power system or set of rules for how powers really work beyond what a character needs to do to make them work - which usually involves some kind of special breathing. As far as you should be concerned, the techniques and powers characters can utilize are more or less elemental magic. If you\'re looking for Hunter X Hunter levels of structure within shounen battling here, you will not find it. If that bothers you, you may have a very hard time watching Demon Slayer. As to whether the story will address these things later on in serious depth (as Hunter X Hunter did not introduce its power system rules by this point in the series either) I cannot comment. I am judging this series as a 26-episode anime, and what is contained within it.\n\nOverall, Demon Slayer is solid in concept while clumsy, but formidable in execution. While it rushes out the gate and stumbles a bit, I feel the author earnestly learning how to tell a better story along the way, and it\'s rewarded by sticking the landing after a couple worrying stumbles on the way there. Hopefully in future entries, the weak elements of Demon Slayer\'s writing will be ironed out. There\'s more good here than bad, but there\'s plenty of room for improvement. While Demon Slayer has lots of potential, it will be tough to live up to it, but it\'s hard not to cheer on the author when you\'re riding the high of a fantastic arc with a satisfying payoff only to realize the first season is winding down for an ending.\n\nCHARACTERS (7/10)\n\n+ Bond between main characters is strong\n+ Demon Slayer corps supporting cast are eccentric and compelling, leave you wanting more\n+ Cast helps the story blur the line between good and evil\n~ MC can feel too powerful at times\n~ Demons can feel like ""monster of the week"" throwaway characters\n- Zenitsu\'s personality is overbearing to the point of being obnoxious\n\nThere are a lot of characters in Demon Slayer, too many to go over here. Because of that, I will keep it to a few groups of people, and my thoughts on each.\n\nTANJIROU & NEZUKO - a very strong sibling relationship, but not creepy or sexualized in any way. Tanjirou is honorable to a fault, as one would expect of a young, capable shounen hero. He is also incredibly powerful, sometimes to the point where he may as well be impervious to injury. Despite this, he does have his limits, and is not always victorious in battle. In fact, he fails a lot, though he often surprises his enemies or sparring partners with his natural talent. Overpowered? Probably, but within reason - as ridiculous as that sounds.\n\nNezuko is adorable, but sometimes felt more like a pet companion rather than a real character. It doesn\'t help that she can\'t really speak, but at times it\'s obnoxiously cute. Speaking of obnoxious...\n\nZENITSU & INOSUKE - Tanjirou\'s eventual travelling companions. Inosuke is a stubborn, short-tempered fighter overflowing with pride. Zenitsu is, well.. mostly a whiny, blubbering coward who is almost constantly screaming.\n\nZenitsu has his moments. Brief moments. Moments of pause, introspection and gorgeous fight scenes. And maybe this is one of those characters that is better seen through the scope of a manga, because then you wouldn\'t be able to *hear* him. I began to dread episodes with Zenitsu in the preview because of how obnoxious he is. If you\'re supposed to like this character and root for him, it\'s a hard sell. While he does get a sympathetic angle and a bit of backstory to explain why he is the way that he is, he\'s also a bit of a degenerate pervert that is played off for cheap laughs, and you always have that in the back of your mind. Overall, I don\'t have a very positive impression of Zenitsu. He\'s fairly selfish and genuinely unlikeable. If he ""gets better"" as the saying goes, it didn\'t happen much here. Again, he does have maybe 5 collective minutes worth of screentime where you can come to an understanding with his repulsive personality, but he\'s so overly exaggerated that you just want to see him grow up as fast as possible - and we know that\'s not happening.\n\nInosuke is also very loud, but in a more tolerable way. He is the type that refuses to run from a fight, and must always prove himself. He clashes with Tanjirou\'s personality to make for a great rival, and when he has vulnerable moments you can really feel how hard it is for him to express his feelings as someone who spent most of his life disconnected from society. As far as the travelling shounen trio goes, his chemistry is far more compatible than Zenitsu. You just know they are going to become great friends and want to see that relationship develop.\n\nTHE DEMON CORPS - There are so many characters within the demon corps that you will meet. They are all an eccentric bunch, but the one that struck a chord with audiences the most was almost certainly a hunter named Shinobu. Soft-spoken and elegant, yet terrifyingly powerful and overflowing with conviction, Shinobu meets Tanjirou and his company about halfway through the series. As far as I am concerned, she is a supporting cast member that has such a great story you wish she was a main character - and a character that leaves you wanting more is always a good thing. For the most part, many of the demon corps characters you will meet don\'t get as much attention as she does, but it is implied that they\'ll have much more screen time in the future. If any of them are half as captivating as Shinobu, good things are in store for Demon Slayer fans.\n\nTHE DEMONS - Again, a large cast, but mostly throwaways. Demons are introduced and then promptly killed in their respective episodes or mini-arcs for the most part until the second half of the series. Some get little backstories, but they are fleeting epilogues when someone you just met is about to die. But they are there to serve part of a larger narrative - that demons are often a product of their tragic past. The more it happens, the more you start to feel that there may be some grand misunderstanding of demonkind, that their circumstances in another life were taken advantage of by a greater evil. And in fact it is part of the implication based on the limited information the series gives us about the story\'s overarching villain, who leaves the limelight as mysteriously as he appears. Again, most demons come and go, but as part of a bigger story and concept of the Demon Slayer universe, there is a lot of potential and it\'s beginning to bare fruit already.\n\nART (10/10)\n\n+ Excellent animation\n+ Consistent quality\n+ Solid direction that matches the source material\n+ Elevates its source material\n\nThis may actually be the best thing about Demon Slayer. And I don\'t mean that in a negative way, but the staff at Ufotable did such an insanely good job elevating the source material for animation that its significance is hard to overstate. From front to back, Demon Slayer is consistently well animated, masterfully directed and is visually coherent and compelling. I would recommend reading the Sakugabooru blog ""DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c THE POWER OF UFOTABLE\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2S HARMONY"" (ep 19 spoilers) if you\'d like to know more about the inner workings of Ufotable and the massive amount of industry experience and skill that came together to make Demon Slayer happen. Almost all of the fights in Demon Slayer are breathtaking spectacles that raise the stakes through the sheer power of what magic only 2D animation can bring. Demon Slayer is full of cuts that demonstrate what truly makes anime special and a worldwide phenomenon. What\'s happening on the screen is sometimes more spectacular than what is actually taking place in the story, but what matters is that not only can you feel the passion of those working on the series and that they truly care about making it the best they can be, but that Ufotable gives their staff a schedule that allows them to create a series like this and give it the attention they felt it deserved.\n\nI could nitpick some 3D/2D hybrid scenes and moments of awkward pacing, but when it comes to TV animation, to ask for more than what was delivered here is silly. Demon Slayer is an anime series any studio would be more than proud to have in their portfolio, and meets a standard of excellence rarely seen in a world of overworked and underpaid animators.\n\n\nSOUND (9/10)\n\n+ Music is tonally appropriate\n+ Sound design elevates the scenes\n\nThe music of Demon Slayer is very appropriate for the time period and helps immerse you into the world. There\'s a few standout themes, but as far as earbugs go Demon Slayer is mostly inoffensive, for better or worse. The sound design and effects also bring more energy to fights and the atmosphere. Overall though, there is nothing here that detracts from the production of the series. The music always plays to the tone of the scene, and the sound is always on point.\n\n\nENJOYMENT (6/10)\n\n+ Made with intent to be as good as they could make it\n~ Mixed feelings in the first half\n~ Many memorable ""good"" and ""bad"" moments, but good outweighs the bad\n~ May be harder to watch for long-time anime fans used to shounen\n\nMy mind races trying to piece together all my thoughts about Demon Slayer, and subsequently breaks trying to condense it into a ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question ""did you enjoy Demon Slayer?"" There were times I was excitedly speechless, times I wanted to turn it off in annoyance, and everything in-between. However, The times where I had negative reactions began to wane as the series went on, and I found myself - to my own disbelief - anxiously waiting for the next episode more and more. And now? I think I ""get it"" - I get what Ufotable staff see in Demon Slayer, and why they put every ounce of effort into making the anime as fantastic as they could have. I get why the fans of the manga assure me that my qualms with this and that will be resolved. I get that the mangaka is learning how to write a story with this many layers and this many characters, and I see that growth throughout the series. As cynical and jaded as I can be, and as much as I may have even subconciously wanted to say that I didn\'t enjoy Demon Slayer... I can\'t say I didn\'t.\n\n\nOVERALL (6/10)\nAll that being said, I have to give Demon Slayer a final score with a nice round number. I\'m not going to lie, it took me a long time to come around to Demon Slayer, but at the end of the day, I kept watching it - and I\'m glad that I did. But I still have to keep all my feelings in mind about it through the weeks. There were times I wanted to drop it, times I didn\'t believe I was going to like it, but rather reluctantly sit through it. I\'m relieved to say that in the end, despite my gripes, that I want to see more and eagerly await a second season. My entire thought process on Demon Slayer is usually ""well, bad thing, but also good thing"", and I like the good things more than i dislike the bad things. At the risk of continuing to repeat myself, i\'ll just give a few other scores to sum up my review.\n\nFIRST HALF: 5/10\nSECOND HALF: 8/10\nZENITSU: 3/10 - this is a failing grade, see me after class\nSHINOBU: 10/10 - tfw she will never ask to see me after class\nOVERALL: 6/10\nEXPECTATIONS: HOPEFUL/10\n              '",Demon Slayer
DiabloMask,"b""\n                Battle shounen, a genre designed to attract a large audience with the least amount of effort, it doesn't require any research or studying, only basic knowledge of what people would like, and this pretty much sums up what Kimetsu no Yaiba is all about, since it's one of the most basic shounen anime I've ever seen.\n\n-The story: it's nothing new, a young boy named Tanjirou has his family massacred by a demon and then trains to become a demon slayer.\nThe story could've been interesting but it suffers from laziness, the writer tries to avoid any complicated conflicts that would require effort to solve.\nFor example, the\n                  ...\n          most interesting part about the story was how Tanjirou had to protect and tame his sister Nezuko who turned into a demon...\n[Spoiler]\nShe gets brainwashed early on by Tanjirou's mentor to be friendly with humans (if he could do that, then why not brainwash more demons?), and she turns out to be strong enough to protect herself and others and even fight other demons (even though she doesn't eat humans, which was established to be the way demons get stronger).\n[/Spoiler]\nThe writing is also too lazy, the characters narrate their own stories, nothing is shown in an interesting way, the writer spoon-feeds you everything.\nEven simple moments such as Tanjirou talking to a girl in early episodes, he literally narrates their conversation instead of showing it to us.\n\n-The characters: nothing about them stands out, Tanjirou is a copy/paste from Midoriya Izuku (My Hero Academia), he's too nice and perfect.\nNezuko is not a proper character since she acts like an animal, she nods and listens to Tanjirou's instructions which means she understands human language, but she can't speak for some reason (she used to speak normally as a human, and all demons so far can speak except for her, so it doesn't make sense, but I guess the writer thinks it's cute).\nUrokodaki, Tanjirou's mentor, a strict oldman that becomes a father figure for Tanjirou, he's an interesting character but we don't know much about him.\nZenitsu, it's early to judge him, but so far he's one of the most annoying comic relief characters ever.\n\n-The world building: the lack of it is confusing, at first it gives you the impression that demons' existance is not commonly known among people, but later on you notice that they are everywhere.\nMaybe it's early to tell if there's going to be anything interesting about the world, but so far it's too basic, it's Japan in the 20th century (not sure which decade) and it has demons, that's basically it.\n\n-The action: this is the best part about the show, I give credit to studio ufotable, it's known for having high quality animations, also the writer came up with creative superpowers that made some cool fights.\nThe only problem is that due to the fast pacing most fights have no build up and end very quickly which makes them forgettable, the only exception was a fight in the early episodes when Tanjirou was trying to learn how to use his superpower.\n\n-The pacing: it feels like modern shounen anime are trying to avoid the slow pacing that Naruto and One Piece are infamous for, but the problem is that they end up too fast paced that you have no time to care about anything.\nTanjirou met a demon slayer and then started training to become one, right after the death of his family, he didn't have time to grieve which took away the shock and sadness of his loss.\nAnd there are many other examples of this problem but I guess you get the point.\n\nOverall this show is worth watching if you want to see cool action (at least it doesn't try to be more than that) but don't expect much from it.\n              """,Demon Slayer

Amonix1,"b'\n                Demon Slayer is easily the most overrated anime ever and arguably one of the most overrated pieces of fiction to ever exist. Demon Slayer is the type of anime that is really only enjoyable when you turn your brain off and just look at the pretty colors on screen. There isn\'t any depth in the story or characters at all and the writing at certain parts is absolutely abhorrent and extremely questionable and yet it\'s rated higher than objectively better anime like mob psycho and Chainsawman for some reason? Demon Slayer can be an enjoyable anime to watch, but the writing certainly isn\'t good.\n\nStory: 5\n\nThere\'s\n                  ...\n          not much to talk about for this category.

The overarching goal that drives the plot is Tanjiro\'s desire to save his sister, but I honestly couldn\'t give less of a fuck about Nezuko because she\'s barely even a character.\n\nCharacters: 3\n\nEvery single character in Demon Slayer is flat and one dimensional and I could summarize 90% of their character in a few words. Tanjiro is a nice empathetic ""good boy,"" Zenitsu is a pussy, Nezuko isn\'t even really a character at all considering she doesn\'t even talk, etc. There isn\'t even any character development in season 1, and if an anime can\'t include meaningful development in 26 episodes, that\'s super questionable writing. \n\nAnimation and art: 10\n\nBesides the ost\'s this is the only good part about Demon Slayer and the main people why Demon Slayer sticks out from other generic poorly written anime. Ufotable absolutely cooked when they made this anime, but I wish that they adapted an anime that\'s actually written well. \n\nEnjoyment: 7\n\nAs I said earlier when you aren\'t asking questions about the story and simply turn your brain off to look at the pretty colors, Demon Slayer can be pretty fun to watch, but I\'d much rather watch something with actual good writing over something with to offer besides good animation\n\nOverall: 6\n\nI can only really recommend this to people who like Shonen Battle anime for the fights and not the story since Demon Slayer doesn\'t offer much besides cool fights and good animation.  Demon Slayer would likely go completely under the radar if it wasn\'t for the pretty colors and animation. The most annoying part about Demon Slayer is how high it\'s rated and I can\'t for the life of me comprehend how this is rated higher than shows that are written objectively better from every possible standpoint like Chainsawman, mob psycho, etc. The animation is great but this doesn\'t offer anything besides that. Just watch Fate if you want something that\'s animated well with good writing.\n              '",Demon Slayer
HarVeeGee,"b'\n                This is maybe the most beautiful shonen anime ever, but beautiful hot garbage is still hot garbage.\n\nAbsolutely awful writing on every level: flat characters; cringe-inducing attempts at humour and, most egregiously of all; a story which is constantly undermining its own stakes and sidestepping any development which might be interesting. \n\nThe set-up is great. Tanjiro returns to his home one day to find his entire family murdered by demons - out of control, bloodthirsty monsters - except for his younger sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a demon herself. Tanjiro\'s goal is to restore her humanity, and to do this he has to become\n                  ...\n          a demon slayer, destroying these monsters while also trying to keep his monstrous sister safe. So far so good, there\'s great prospects for genuine emotional and moral conflict there. How does Tanjiro feel about murdering monsters which must have been once like her sister, normal, often very kind, people? How does he manage his duties while also managing Nezuko\'s uncontrollable bloodlust, and would be need to do anything ethically dubious to keep his beloved sister alive? Is it morally right for him to try and keep her alive while he tries to find a cure which may not actually exist, given how dangerous demons are?\n\nThe show sidesteps all of these concerns. Turns out, Nezuko isn\'t an out of control monster, but a NICE demon, harmless like a nonverbal child or a puppy, I guess because it\'s cute for her to be that way, but also because reasons. She is the only demon who can subsist on sleep, rather than blood, also because reasons. At one stage Nezuko sleeps for two years to conveniently handwave her out of the story while Tanjiro is doing a training montage ffs! And then around episode 10, which is about when I bailed, he meets two demons who are basically normal, good people, the demonic taint not making them evil like everyone else, able to live normal (albeit eternal) lives aside from not being able to go out during the day. Hey so I guess being a demon isn\'t really that bad then if you find a way to manage the condition, turns out there\'s no need to keep looking for the cure! No, he still needs to find it I guess, because reasons.\n\nThe entire show has this problem. No depth, no stakes, no character development, and everything constantly being handwaved away. Tanjiro is unfailingly kind and virtuous no matter what befalls him, but not in any sort of interesting way; more like the mangaka never really thought about how any of the horrible things he\'s seen might affect him other than making him a bit sad sometimes. Other characters are always dull & one note, defined by a single characteristic. Nothing which happens seems to matter very much and it\'s impossible to get invested.\n\nIt bears repeating how horrible the ""comedy"" is. It\'s always literally just people shouting.\n\nBut hey, it\'s beautiful and visually distinct, Nezuko has a very marketable ""mascot"" design, and it has good fight scenes if you\'re a fan of style and not that fussed about substance. I guess those things are all a shounen series needs to be successful!\n              '",Demon Slayer
tigermaskshinobi,"b""\n                A typical but watchable shonen mostly carried by some great animation and music. Nothing particularly new or creative about this world, this story, these characters. Most of the characters are under-established, quite generic and aren't really that interesting beyond their design, Backstories whenever featured feel sluggish and forgettable. I wasn't able to connect with a lot of the emotion in this anime, mainly because of how blunt it can be in it's execution, with extremely theatrical and unnatural dialogue. The humorous scenes are also a hit or miss but it did have it's moments and offered some good laughs along the way. One thing I\n                  ...\n          really liked though were the villains, not as characters but I felt most of them had very interesting and especially creative powers, which worked very well with some great animation and choreography for it's action sequences. Despite all its flaws however, it still does manage to be just about entertaining enough for me to allot twenty minutes of my time every week for it, and wouldn't mind it getting renewed for another season, in fact I think it has potential, even if it unlikely will, to break it's generic shell. Also a shout out to the OP and ED, great songs complimented by great visuals.\n\n6/10\n              """,Demon Slayer
Killuagay,"b""\n                An extremely mediocre story with good animations. That would be a fair description of Kimetsu no Yaiba. This anime blew up for the amazing artwork it has and a good soundtrack to go with it. But the story and the characters are pretty poor if I'm completely honest. \n\nStory (4/10): A very basic story about a man called Tanjiro who wants to make his little sister human again after she became a demon in ep 1. The story from that point onwards was pretty predictable and flat. Some minor fights that didn't add anything in particular to the story and some comedic moments that were\n                  ...\n          mediocre at best. \n\nArt (10/10): Ufotable did an outstanding job in animating and adapting the manga based story. The fights are beautiful and is the main reason why this anime blew up out of proportions. The dark background with strong colors to contrast, the fights are truly something you don't see in other animes. \n\nSound (8/10): A very good soundtrack that gives the audience a lot of emotions. Especially during fights, the OST makes it so much better and is above average compared to a lot of other anime. \n\nCharacter (5/10): The main character Tanjiro is probably one of the most boring characters that you will see during the course of the show. His two support characters though are funny and I think everyone agrees that Zenitsu is the best character in the show. He is well written and funny, with an annoying voice. Inosuke is a very clumsy and intense, which makes some good scenes with him as well. But for Tanjiro, he is nothing special. Just the typical shounen anime protagonist that cares for his friends and family. There is not much depth to his motives and I think that even the smallest of villains are way more interesting than Tanjiro. I tried to give him time, but his character just didn't impress me at all. \n\nEnjoyment (6/10): With a predictable storyline and a boring protagonist, I can not, unfortunately, give this a higher rating. I did enjoy the show, mostly because of the amazing animation by ufotable, however as I said, there was not much to it. \n\nOverall (6/10): Give it a try, it is only 26 episodes as of now and is worth a watch. But dont go into it with too high expectations as many of us did.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Collaide,"b'\n                To be honest, I don\'t understand what this show is going for.\n\nIt was a well executed show at first. Then when the main character recieves his weapon, everything changes. The seriousness built up around the main character, the atmospheric vibe, is all destroyed by some of these ""comedic"" moments. As someone who enjoys Black Clover, with Asta screaming at the top of his lungs in nearly every episode, as someone whose favourite character in MHA is Bakugou, and as someone who loves One Punch Man\'s Speed-o\'-sound Sonic, these shows just absolutely NAIL that type of character. These shows are more light hearted in nature, which\n                  ...\n          makes them fit in.\n\nThe sword forger guy is just silly, and his ""jokes"" and the reactions to them are out of place. No attempt to give the humour any meaning or context, or make the humour fit appropriately within the calm setting the anime has set up to this point. But it gets worse. When we later on meet a doctor, her companion is also annoying. But it gets worse. When we once again encounter Zenitsu and Inosuke the show takes a turn in the worst way possible.\n\nI understand that we are meant to feel sympathy for the demons but it\'s done in a poorly executed manner. They build them up as ruthless, kill them off, and then while they\'re dying they have a ten minute long flashback about how their traumatic childhood forced them to want to eat people in exchange for being strong. Not only does that not make sense, it actively undermines the satisfaction of killing off the villain.\n\nNow, villains don\'t have to be black and white, like Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter. He is crafted as a likeable character as well as a fierce villain. They are given a personality. Zenitsus gimmick would be interesting for a demon, but for him to have it and do the same thing in every episode gets old. After the first 2 times he does it.\n\nAs for the pacing, it\'s really really inconsistent. In the beginning of the show it appeared though it would have a fast but steady pacing. Nope. Some fights span 5 seconds, other span 2 episodes. Sometimes we spend half an episode watching a dead demons back story, which completely removes the tension. If you wanted that backstory, introduce it when you introduce the villain not after he dies. When the ""bad guy"" is dead I don\'t want to watch his entire traumatic childhood. If these stories were told before they die, maybe I would actually feel something for them WHEN they die. That being said Tanjiros reactions to their deaths are always bittersweet and well executed.\n\nPacing when it comes to the ""funny"" bits is also wierd. 5 minutes of Zenitsu saying the same thing over and over again is NOT funny. I mean, if new things happened, if the characters said different things each time in new ways, or if there was a dialogue between them I wouldn\'t mind. But it\'s just Zenitsu monologuing the same couple of lines for 5 minutes. I skipped it every single time. Inosuke had this problem in the beginning as well but got better as the show progressed. I hoped it would do this for every character but it refuses to.\n\nSomething else it refuses for its characters are words. Yes. Often, characters do not respond when spoken to. And sometimes characters don\'t listen to what\'s being said. And it made me hate almost every demon slayer. This is how Inosuke was introduced. Hot tempered, refuses to listen, even though he talks, while Zenitsu in the same scene, refuses to talk. Tanjiro refuses to talk as well. Tanjiro later refuses to talk to the Hashira. Like, I\'m sorry, but building up story moments and refusing to build an understanding between MAIN CHARACTERS but then doing it for VILLAINS is infuriating. Basically the only character you like is Tanjiro, because he\'s the least stupid and not evil.\n\n...with all that being said there are certainly qualities in this anime, though it is not related to the characters or the pacing. The story is mostly good. The fights are beautiful and exhilirating. It\'s what I enjoyed about it, and I endured the other aspects to hopefully find new, more redeemable qualities, and it got slightly better after reaching rock bottom.\n\nThe Art is mostly beautiful... however, why do no female characters have pupils? Why don\'t the demons have them? How do they see? Half the characters have lifeless eyes and it doesn\'t help to make them feel more alive. There is an overuse of the 3D models as well. They look worse and very distinct from the drawn characters and its breaking the immersion to needlessly switch back and forth in scenes when they just .... STAND STILL! One thing to do it in fights to allow better camera movements, but when they are standing still talking.\n\nI will watch the next season, but I want it to be better than this one. I want it to be good and I believe it can be better. A lot of talent and effort was put into this.\n\nEDIT: Because I think I may have been unfair to the series in a variety of ways, I vow to rewatch this sooner or later. When I do, this review will get updated.\n              '",Demon Slayer
candylov,"b""\n                As many other people say, this show is very shounen-based. I give it a 10 on all the categories to rate this anime.\n\nOne of the disappointments of the show for me was that the cliffhangers sometimes ended at a point which a sensitive person would feel quite anxious and worried in. Instead of giving me anticipation to see how the protagonist overcomes his next battle, sometimes I am given this awful anxiety in my heart waiting to dissipate. \n\nThe second disappointment is that the characters aren't introduced so that you can immediately like them if you are a sensitive person like me. A few characters\n                  ...\n          have annoyed me because of how unsympathetic they were in a tense situation, but they have compensated later on by revealing their more tolerable character better. This is more of a problem made by the author than the studio, I believe.\n\nThe disappointments I listed above are nothing too great to effect the enjoyment of the normal watcher of this show. Watch it if you want something to binge on and some thrill and action. There isn't anything mentally sophisticated in this show: it's just kill demons, kill demons, train, and kill demons.\n              """,Demon Slayer
CodeBlazeFate,"b""\n                *spoilers for Kimetsu no Yaiba*\n\nIt\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s easy to be let down when your expectations are lofty. Unfortunately, disappointment is more than just a decent or lackluster product coming about after one anticipates a masterpiece. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s perhaps even more frustrating when you set them accordingly and humble them, simply expecting the work in question to be a decent or entertaining action spectacle and time passer with some heart to it. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not quite the same as the phrase \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93I expected nothing and I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m still disappointed\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd, but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s similarly annoying and deflating, since a work fails to even live up to the idea of being tolerable.\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba\n                  ...\n          tries desperately to be the show pictured above, and there are glimpses of that potential. Unfortunately, the show is bogged down by a complex, interwoven series of issues that make the show downright insufferable. The worst part is that it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not like the story itself is even that bad. Sure, there are certainly strange worldbuilding decisions and some aggravating ass-pulls, but the issue is more a matter of presentation, of the storytelling, as well as some of the characterization.\n\nBefore we tackle the complex web of issues that bog down the show, let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s examine the positives and what the show was trying to go for. Director Haruo Sotozaki and his team at ufotable did a pretty good job with the visuals. Sure, the 3D backgrounds can vary wildly in quality from relatively acceptable to Holy God Jesus Christ help help help, but outside of that and moments where said assets are pretty clearly reused, there isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t a ton to complain about regarding the visuals. It does happen a bit too often and the colors can be a bit much, but barring those and the spinning CGI room fight in the middle of the show, the visuals are pretty vivid and stylish in a way that works. The action animation tends to be fairly fluid and both the various demon powers and sword breathing techniques are stunning. They\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re all vibrant and unique, while not even needing the studio\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s trademark lighting effects to make them shine. Everyone gushes over the explosive final sequence in episode 19 but even most of the other fights have gorgeous, bombastic attacks that are a treat for the eyes. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not exactly the studio\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s best work or anything, but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s another solid-looking show by one of the most reputable studios in anime nowadays.\n\nThe music is also a highlight, as Yuki Kajiura has decided to go with an eerie chanting approach instead of the bombastic choirs most of her work is littered with. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s an interesting change of pace, even if not always the most pleasant, though the more standard orchestral tracks aren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t anything to write home about. This isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t one of her best OSTs --not by a long shot-- but it is an interesting change of pace. The OP, \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Gurenge\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd by LiSA, is a solid rockin banger that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s harder than what we normally hear from this artist. The ED, \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93from the edge\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd by FictionJunction feat. LiSA is more of a haunting yet still determined piece that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s befitting of the show\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s sound and atmosphere. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s also the special episode 19 ED, \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Kamado Tanjirou no Uta\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd by Go Shiina ft. Nami Nakagawa. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a beautiful and explosive chanting and singing piece befitting of the most bombastic moment in the show. \n\nWith all that being said, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s time to discuss what the point of the story was. On paper, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s simple, what many would call standard shounen fare. Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s family was killed by demons with his now demon sister being the only member he has left. He sets out on a quest to restore her while becoming a more proficient demon hunter, climbing up the ranks as he encounters various demons with varying ties to the ultimate demon they must defeat: Muzan. \n\nWhat\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s supposed to really elevate this idea outside of the cast of characters he meets along the way is the emotional storytelling that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s at the forefront. Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s sister still accompanies him and protects him despite now being a demon, so he protects her as the only family he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s got left. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s better able to show compassion to demons cuz he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s seen firsthand that they were once human, only now corrupted by an evil curse that leaves them craving human flesh and blood. He inevitably has to kill them, but not without learning about who they once were as most of them air out any final regrets or personal backstories from when they were a human or early on in their new lives as demons. In theory, this pathos-driven storytelling should make this series emotionally resonant. Have the demons\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 pasts and motivations be carefully sprinkled out before the final burst of feels while having their current selves have even the slightest ounce of humanity and decency, and suddenly it becomes easy to feel for them as they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re finally put down. Sure, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re never to root for them, but since Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s an empathetic protagonist, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re meant to empathize alongside him, feel the tragedy of how these people were turned demonic as they are finally put to rest on the journey to end this curse once and for all.\n\nUnfortunately, this show doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t exactly like the idea of subtlety, knowing when to place backstory information, or respecting one\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s emotional intelligence. Instead, every time a mustache-twirling puppy kicker motherfucker is on the verge of death, we spend several minutes on their sad anime backstory before they finally get beheaded and destroyed. \n\nThere are a few critical problems with this approach that makes the experience far more maddening than resonant. Pacing and characterization are forsaken for big sad plot twist backstories that do have some obvious signposting on account of the demons alluding to them, but nothing\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s built up through clever environmental storytelling or having any surrounding folk familiar with any given demon allude to anything for the audience to piece together. We simply interrupt the fight or death scene to dump a sad anime flashback that can range anywhere from 2 minutes to over an episode long! Most of the time, these boss fights involve just pure evil monsters! While that can work fine for grunts we never learn about, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to care when for 90% of their screen time, most of these beasts are almost entirely one-dimensional baddies. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s emotional manipulation at its most glaring, while being a tremendous pace-breaker.\n\nThe first time this happens is in the opening moments of episode 5, where a dedmon known for eating Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s new master\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s former pupils explains that he was sealed off in the land we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re currently fighting him in. Fucking really? We paused the fight for this and are suddenly supposed to give a shit? Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s meant to empathise with this?! How about in episodes 12 and 13 where the bongo demon was a disgraced former 12 Kazuki member (i.e a disgraced member of the big bad organization of the series) in a couple of very intrusive flashbacks, only for Tanjirou to not fuck up his scattered writings so we can learn he was a disgraced writer, too? Isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t this a little excessive and ridiculous? \n\nThen there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the spider family arc from episodes 15-21, where two backstories end up hurting the worst. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the spider mom who was a victim of abuse by the rest of her forcefully made-up family. She mentions this once or twice after the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93son\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd threatens to have the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93father\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd beat her up again. Therefore, when Tanjirou faces her and is ready to strike, she welcomes her demise with open arms, reaching for death so she can finally be free from abu-oh here\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the flashback where we see her getting beaten up despite us already knowing this and not needing it shown to us. Oh dear. The scene isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t outright ruined by this, and it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s one of the two times this show managed to be effective in making a demon\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s fate seem resonant and tragic. Still, this is more than a little intrusive. \n\nCan\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be worse than the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93son\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd, Rui! Skipping over episode 19\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s epic scene since that has some core issues of its own that will be addressed soon, the bulk of 20 and 21 is spent on this cunt\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s backstory. See, he used to be a frail boy who was enamored by a story of familial sacrifice as a father risked his life for his kid. Unable to capture that semblance of overwhelming love from his own family who sheltered him, he felt empty. Then, he was infected and became a demon, so his father tried to kill him. He killed the parents in retaliation, only for the mother to apologize for not birthing him with a healthy body in her dying words. Horrified by the realization that he killed his loving family and that his father was probably planning a murder suicide, he was able to be emotionally manipulated by Muzan and he infected other demons so he can \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93recreate\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd the family he never thought he had until it was too late. This is why he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a foil to Tanjirou and his genuine familial bond with his sister. This is why he took an interest in the girl to the point of trying to force her into the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93family\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd while trying to kill Tanjirou.\n\nDid we really need several flashbacks over the course of 2 episodes to explain this...as he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s dying?! Fuck having pieces of his backstory carefully fed to the audience before a quick final reveal is had as he airs out his last regrets and thoughts. Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s pad out the runtime and drag out every attempt at whoring out them tears for as long as humanly possible!\n\nThe middle portion as a whole is the perfect encapsulation of everything wrong with the series! We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not even done here as the intrusive flashbacks that often pad out and emotionally manipulate instead of earning those tears, aren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t solely applicable to the demons! Tanjirou, and a certain yellow turd we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll get to have them as well! Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s go back to the fan favorite moment in episode 19. Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s on the ropes against Rui before we flash back to a moment with his long-since gone father dancing with fire. Understanding this and using his water-breathing training, Tanjirou is somehow able to perform a PHOENIX BREATHING ATTACK that requires perfectly concentrated breathing. This comes outta nowhere with no semblance of foreshadowing or anything beforehand. In the same scene, his sister, Nezuko, has been bleeding out thanks to Rui entrapping her with sharp strings. Seeing that Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s struggling in his final efforts to finish off Rui, she somehow manages to unlock a demon art involving blood, and uses that to aid Tanjirou and disarm the wires so he can land the killing blow. Well, that is until episode 20 revealed that despite Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s epic decapitation fireworks display, Rui...somehow decapitated himself to survive, and he can just put himself back together.\n\nLet\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s disregard how when demons are decapitated, they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re supposed to just fuckin die after a bit as that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the surefire method to kill them until this contradiction comes up. Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s ignore how this utterly cheapens the already stupid ending to the previous episode by retroactively robbing Tanjirou and the audience of that (less than) earned victory so a Hashira named Giyuu can land the killing blow instead. This is yet another example of the show just pulling flashbacks outta thin air to justify something because Kimetsu no Yaiba isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t interested in doing anything organically. It doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t care about anything being earned! As long as the tears are dragged out of those eye sockets of yours, let thou be BLUDGEONED and your precious scenes be interrupted! Akame ga Kill deserves a fucking apology at this rate, and that show\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s even worse than this one!\n\nEpisode 17 is a particularly intolerable episode for this as well, but it goes about things in a different manner. Here\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Zenitsu. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the absolute fucking worst. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a coward, a pervert, a whining, screaming little pissant who never shuts the fuck up and gets in the way always until he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s knocked out so that the badass within can perform an epic thunder-breating style technique to save the day. We saw this once in episode 12, he mastered the technique and looked cool doing it. Apparently that wasn;t enough as the show has to drag out the 17th episode with flashback after flashback after flashback after flashback explaining that he has self-loathing due to his personal and combat failures cuz he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a fuck-up, so he has to master this one technique and it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s supposed to be epic and moving when he does the technique we already saw him do 5 episodes ago but with extra movements and whatnot. \n\nFuck off!\n\nUnfortunately, we still have the characters to deal with. We can ignore how weird it is that no one in Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s family aside from maybe his dad even knew about demons despite them being a widespread issue. We can ignore how demon slayers aren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t officially sanctioned by the government despite citizens across several towns and villages dealing with demon problems on a widespread scale. We don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t need to focus on worldbuilding when the botched pathos and generally awful cast are more important issues!\n\nTanjirou himself isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t a particularly bad protagonist. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s pretty empathetic and sometimes that gets used pretty tastefully like when one of the demons dies a horrific death due to uttering Muzan\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s name and his curse making her body turn against itself, so all he can do is hand her the temari ball she used as she\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s fading away. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not particularly hard to root for him as he isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t whiny or obnoxious, either. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just sorta safe and there isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t much to him outside of being empathetic and driven to save and care for his sister. There are times, especially towards the end, where he becomes close to being a gary stu since he's never in the wrong, he moralizes like crazy and always wins that way, and can just shove off injuries like broken ribs like it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s nothing in the heat of battle. He also never shuts up when monologuing about anything in the heat of battle. Sure, sometimes it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s good to hear him internalize demon attacks and make strategies on the fly. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s what any of us would do when facing a boss in a video game, except it becomes rather excessive here. The show loves being excessive about everything, don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t you know? That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s why most of the comedy is loud and obnoxious and the flashbacks and monologues are the way they are. \n\nNezuko is...an object and a plot-device more so than she is an actual character. Sure, she gets taught to treat all humans like family and there are a couple of funny and adorable scenes with her. Still, she gets shoved in a box for most of the show while being the object of admiration and affection by many. Obviously she can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t fight in the sun now that she\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a demon, but even at night, she only comes out when it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s convenient after episode 6 and oftentimes, is in an elongated slumber before only waking up when the next arc is about to start or when we need another emotionally manipulative victory lap like in episode 5. Great female deuteragonist treatment, guys!\n\nThen we have Zenitsu. Fuck Zenitsu. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s genuinely insufferable for reasons mentioned above. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s almost nothing redeemable about this cowardly pervert who spends most of his time lusting after women and screaming at the top of his lungs over everything! Sure, there are a couple of moments when he shows actual decency and even tries to help Tanjirou and Nezuko, but most of the time, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re left with an insufferable cunt whose screams and cries are close to early Black Clover levels of grating. Even his self-loathing which came out of nowhere in episode 17, isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even brought up again, almost like it was never meant to factor into his character at all and instead was only used to trick the audience into feeling things while the runtime got padded for like 10 minutes.\n\nThe final member of the main tetrad is Inosuke and he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the only fun one. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s basically a somewhat sadistic meathead who loves fighting and has only one brain cell. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s stupid, earnest, constantly getting Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s name wrong, and is the only one capable of allowing for some actual character chemistry that isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t just idiots screaming and whining about everything. His stubborn pride and sense of violence are exploited in hilarious ways as well, like his refusal to accept that he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s injured several times before passing out. Pig mask man over here is just bonkers and he actively elevates the show almost every time he's onscreen. There are weird gimmicks they incorporate with him every now and then but otherwise, he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s an genuinely fun character who provides most of the comedy that actually lands in the show. \n\nThe only other characters that are worth mentioning are Shinobu and Muzan. Shinobu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s one of the few Hashira, i.e the highest-ranked demon slayers. She and Giyuu are some of the only remotely tolerable ones considering the rest are boring or aggravating upon their episode 22 introductions. She has this delicate air to her that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s contrasted by her maliciousness towards demons, making for a simultaneously cute and disturbing character who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s fun to watch. Plus, her heart to heart with Tanjirou as she encourages him to keep up his breathing training is nice. It also elevates Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s character a tad when he senses unbridled anger within her that she generally keeps buried deep down after her dying sister expressed that she wanted to always see Shinobu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s smile. It adds more layers to her character than what anyone else has so far, and it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s regrettable that the show can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t have more down-to-earth moments where the characters can just breathe, talk, and engage in anything personal. \n\nAs for Muzan, he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just a motherfucker who is so extra that he kills people in every single scene he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s in. He\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s in control like when Tanjirou tries to strike him down in public only to see the man\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s wife and kid before the dude takes advantage of Tanjirou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s stunned horror and confusion to turn a random passerby into a demon while the family isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t looking. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not much else to him so far, but every scene he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s in becomes fun and amusing with how brutal this man is. Every time he shows up in-person, his body count increases. There are other characters who are sadly rather obnoxious like the dude in episodes 8-11 who constantly simps for his demon doctor lady, but said lady herself is one of the few remotely interesting and likable characters here. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a shame most of the cast leans towards the boring and obnoxious side, and that they and many others are constantly bogged down by these intrusive flashbacks that are often meant to define them.\n\nSo, yeah, the show\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s incessant usage of flashbacks that constantly drag out episodes and interrupt fight scenes to justify stupid bullshit for the sake of epic reddit twitter moments and MUH FEELS is actively insulting. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s way too many of these, making an otherwise fast-paced experience slow down to a crawl! It completely cheapens the story and any semblance of pathos since almost nothing ever feels earned and so much time is wasted to meet that 26 episode quota. While a lot of shounen such as One Piece and Naruto are notorious for their adaptations having slow moment to moment pacing, the fact that KnY manages to do this with a short episode count after the first 9 episodes starts becoming even more grating since it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not like the show was drawn-out from the start. It really feels like they were stretching and padding to reach episode and runtime quotas. Even the cast and humor suffer from this on top of both often being obnoxious. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a shame since there are a couple of fun and engaging characters, but we have to put up with Zenitsu, and all the flashbacks and whatnot. The fights can be somewhat entertaining every once in a while, and there are some moments that truly are resonant. However, apart from these, the music being solid, and there being a couple of downright gut-busting moments with Inosuke, this show is a wash.\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba has no chill or respect since it has all the time in the world to force feelings rather than earn them. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to understate how this approach to storytelling and presentation utterly kills the show. The writing outside of that isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t even particularly broken. There aren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t a ton of plotholes or asinine moments and mechanics that don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t make sense. Outside of a few asspulls, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not like the story on its own is terrible. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s all just bogged down by the myriad of intertwined bullshit bogging the show down. This review may seem a bit too harsh, all things considered. However, it is that way because the show presents these moments of beauty and potential, only to squander the bulk of all that while being loud and obnoxious. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s why the first 4 episodes are the best part, as the show only really became unbearable after episode 5 hit. The last 4 episodes are also relatively bearable outside of a few sticking points, but that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s like \xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9c of the series that isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t constantly annoying or maddening. Thankfully the movie would come along and show what this series is truly capable of, but that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a story for another time.\n              """,Demon Slayer
RazelBorg,"b""\n                Demon Slayer = 3/10\nDemon Slayer is one of the worst anime ever created. With all the demon slayer hype I thought I was missing out,\nbut after watching the first 8 episodes, I realized that I've now missed out on 3 hours of my life.\nStory = 10%\nPretty pictures = 90%\nStory? The story could of been interesting I guess, but it's just not. I think the best way to describe the story\nis Tanjiro playing on easy mode and he's acting like everything is difficult. He could of saved everyone, but he's \ntoo busy acting. It also doesn't feel like he has the freedom to go anywhere as\n                  ...\n          if he's hard stuck on this path, \nlike a video game. Anyways the story feels really forced and too easy.\n\nPretty Pictures? Yes, every episodes I watched was beautiful. I think the main reason they made this anime,\nwas for tik tok fan compilation or something. Because I don't think anyone really watches this anime for the \nstory, but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nOverall I think the story had a good concept, but it was poorly executed. The animation is awesome, but I'm not\nwasting anymore time on this anime, it's too predictable and boring.\n\nAnyways That's my review! ^_^\n              """,Demon Slayer
KanghisKhan,"b'\n                Demon Slayer was definitely a genre defining show.\nThere were countless previous attempts on creating a different version of shounen genre and this show is as enjoyable as other greats (HxH and FMA). \n\nDemon slayer has amazing animation, story, and build up but what really surprised me was its cinematography.  In the main arc of this season, there were numerous fight scenes where clever use of camera and transitions got me super engaged in the  moment.  \n\nCharacters in first season were nothing spectacular, but it seems like the show will introduce most of its cast in the upcoming seasons and I am excited\n                  ...\n          to see how each new characters will develop.\n\nMusic, in classic Ufotable fashion was amazing, gave me goosebumps and was often what define a scene from a good to a great scene.\n\nThis is overall an amazing anime as it can easily be a gateway anime (has lighthearted moments, great fights, animation) and is so enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone that has the time to watch. \nStory 9, Art: 10, Sound: 10, Character 8, Enjoyment: 10, Overall: 10\n              '",Demon Slayer
Ellenwitch,"b""\n                I remember being unsure to see this, as I normally don't pay attention to top rated shows by their number, and give it a shot when I'm interested. But having a few friends loving it, made me curious. So I gave it a shot, and like my friends, loved it. Demon Slayer really is quite the anime that I recommend to anyone.\n\nThe cast of characters are great. Even ones that didn't seem like much at first, suddenly turned out to be great characters in their own right. The overall theme is just something I adore. From the settings, backgrounds, to the sound in general. It's\n                  ...\n          really pleasing.\n\nDemon Slayer is a must watch for sure.\n              """,Demon Slayer
ShanAsuna,"b""\n                I stumbled upon this anime through a YouTuber's review of One Punch Man season 2. I'm not joking, and what an amazing find.\n\nThe YouTuber reviewing One Punch Man s2 was lamenting the drop in the show's animation quality because the genius animation team in charge of OPM season 1 had shifted over to work on Kimetsu no Yaiba. Curious by what sort of anime would tempt the godly animation team to go over I picked up KNY.\n\nFirst off, true to the genius of this team of animators, the animation in KNY is GODLY. Truthfully, there is no anime released in 2019 that has art and\n                  ...\n          animation that's at KNY's level, that's how good it is. The background, the use of lighting, colours, the amalgamation of traditionally drawn art and CGI is flawless. It's ufotable, it's the team that made OPM 1, so yes, it's sublime. Can't find better words to describe it, just go watch it.\n\nNext, the soundtrack. It's pretty good from the get-go, you can feel your emotional heartstrings being tugged exactly where the creators wanted them. But when you reach certain key episodes (yes, including the critically acclaimed ep 19), the pristine use of soundtrack to enhance the emotional intensity, the viewer's experience, would bring tears to your eyes. Literally.\n\nThe story isn't some mind-blowing novelty but it delivers. It focuses on familial bonds and the main character's kindness. It's shounen but with a softer, emotional touch. Maybe it's due to the author being a female. In any case, I really liked the story. The presentation of the family theme was done just right, it's not cringey, it's not cheesy, it's quite convincing so I found it an immersive experience.\n\nFinally, I must say the ability of this show to amalgamate all the different elements, animation, lighting, soundtrack, fight scenes, emotional scenes, comedic effect, is really something admirable. Usually, a show can do well on a couple of things or even all the different elements but fail to amalgamate all these wonderful things into a cohesive viewing experience. But Kimetsu no Yaiba managed to synergise all its strong elements such that they become better than their individual parts.\n\nI'm so glad I found this anime.\n              """,Demon Slayer
guysomeone0,"b""\n                The newest seasonal by ufotable? The OP by LiSA? SiGn Me Up RiGhT nOw!\n\nAnd Kimetsu no Yaiba has not disappointed. Ufotable has really dug into their unlimited budget into making this anime, and they produced, imo, one of the best anime this season. The art style is unique and bold, similar to AoT season 1 with clean, thick lines. The animation by ufotable, is as always, near movie level and harmonizes excellently with the art. \n\nThe execution of Kimetsu no Yaiba, is without a doubt, amazing. The camera work and 360 rotation during epic battle scenes, the sound effects with every slash and hit, and\n                  ...\n          the small details that are painstakingly folded into each episode accentuate the anime. Each OST in the scenes always convey the right emotion, all while sticking to classic historical Japanese songs in the period which the story takes place. In addition, the twist of modern instrumentals give them the fantastical element that makes them truly beautiful. \n\nThe choreography is so awe-inspiring that it deserves its own paragraph. I'm not sure if many people have noticed it yet, but the voice actors really put passion and heart into their characters. For example, in one scene where Urokodaki is sending Tanjiro off to the Final Selection, he talks about a boy's growing appetite. If one listens closely, they can actually hear the amusement in his voice, showing how much work the VA put into his character. Tanjiro's tears sounded and felt completely real when disaster struck, unlike the embarrassing screaming that other VA's have in other animes.\n\nEach story has their flaws, and Kimetsu no Yaiba is not immune to this. The story and character falls a little flat. While the setting of the anime is interesting, the way the story progresses is predictable, as it follows the Shonen model complete with a call to action, a training arc, and a test of worthiness. The characters also fall victim to this, as they are, at their core, Shonen stereotypes. Urokodaki is the sensei that doesn't want to let his student go, Tanjiro is a classic Shonen protagonist that wants to protect everyone after starting off weak and becoming strong.\n\nIn the end, I can only rave so much about Kimetsu no Yaiba. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and always look forward to the next episode every week. I rate it 10/10, and hope you enjoy it as much as I do, shoud you choose to watch it.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Fierrza,"b'\n                Why is Demon Slayer Bad?? or Zombie Slayer Well, that should be easy to understand but If you don\'t I\'ll try to explain. Just boring generic predictable shounen trash that\'s all. There is nothing unique or interesting about this story if you have seen any other shounen then you have already seen Demon Slayer it\'s like a hurricane from every Shounen and thrown into one anime in a straight line heading for disaster. This show has nothing original, zero creativity. This is basically my hero academia, attack on titan/ Tokyo ghoul thrown into one series and tons of other shounen series it could and just\n                  ...\n          ripped them off.\n\nStory(1): The story follows some goodie happy to be alive character that comes home and finds his family to savagely murdered by demons, and the only surviving family member is his sister due to plot armor. Due to his surprise, she is attacked by a demon slayer because that\'s his job he slays demons. people always talk about cliche anime this is one of them. A demon slayer of the highest rank(we the audience didn\'t know at the start of the anime he was but now after watching it we know he\'s the highest rank) comes along to slay a demon but because the main character cried and then somehow persuades him to let his sister live. However then this mysterious dude for whatever reason which was never explain said ""why not imma let you guys off the hook and while we\'re at it ill send you a guy were then he can train you to then become a demon slayer, HEYHEY imma just hand out golden passes today any demon can live"" its like WHAT I have seen some cliche things but this is the icing on the cliche cake. Just so unrealistic I was laughing while watching because of how stupid it was. THE MAN IS TRAINED TO KILL DEMONS but just because the main character cried and whimpered it\'s that easy to persuade him TRASH TRASH. JUST ANOTHER  Shounen here we go again.\n\nIt\'s so infuriating to watch this. Why do PEOPLE PRAISE this to high heaven? And the \n 2 plots of the story are to get his sister back to human and get revenge for his family.  2 very stupid plots one because the first plot is unrealistic we know demons can talk and we know they don\'t need to attack humans we seen this in the 2 kind demons that helped the main character and his sister. Then there\'s the typical training arc trying to go to the academy always have the academy.  Again the main character gets everything handed to him from the author due to plot convenience, and the typical shounen of the never give up and things come my way\n\n\nCharacters(1) The other characters in the anime are HORRIBLE the other protagonist with yellow hair, a loser that cries all the time. Then only character worth watching was the bore guy. And then his sister one of the most hyped-up characters ever ""oh shes soo amazing MY WAFU"" NOO  she only comes out when the plot needs her whether it\'s for fanservice or too just be there, she serves no real purpose there other demons more interesting than her. The main character is so boring to watch everyone else is dying to these very powerful ""zombies"" (cause demons don\'t eat humans they possess them) and he just walks up and spams op abilities over and over. Never for a second was I left in suspense NEVER.\n\n\nArt(3): Something else people were hyping up. Seems to me if an anime has vibrant colors, flashing lights, it makes it good NOOOOO, I have seen anime for 2008 that Looks better than this. Because the show was so horribly done it felt like a kids show well its a Shounen so it is. Demons didn\'t even look intimidating for a show that got an insane budget its sad to say it was a waste. \n\n\nOverall(1): Final thoughts the main character that gets everything handed to him. We all know how bad Shounen can be, with the lack of creativity and depth but this Shounen is something different IT BRINGS ZERO CREATIVITY or DEPTH. The plot instantly cured my Insomnia. The same soundtrack was spammed throughout the entire series. The animation was far from good. This story shouldn\'t even be called a story I\'ve seen henti with better plots then Demon Slayer. With the amount of hype, its getting makes zero sense.\n              '",Demon Slayer
asjunewoo,"b""\n                I'm new to anime and the shonen genre so I watched this with an outsider's perspective compared to many other viewers. \n\nFirst off, the show is very enjoyable to watch. The story flows smoothly and there isn't an episode in this first season that's dull.\nThe art and animation is absolutely beautiful and sound design was spectacular.\nThat being said, the character tropes were a little stereotypical, espescially Zenitsu as a shitty, comic-relief character.

I found myself really connected to all of them. The only gripe I might have is that Zenitsu is over the top at times and was really annoying, but that might be intentional.

This show is an overrated piece of garbage that had the potential to be not.\n\nThe story starts with Kamado family bonding then fast forward, they are killed by a demon and while they are killed the MC, Tanjiro was away. When he got back, he was shocked. Nezuko, the only survivor of the attack, was on the verge on dying then she became a demon. Giyu arrives at the scene to kill the demon, which is Nezuko, so he and Tanjiro fought a bit but in the end, because this garbage is so unoriginal, Giyu spares Nezuko for\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0no\n                  ...\n          logical reason. After that, Tanjiro then made a resolve. REVENGE!!(Ugh. Cringe level over 9000). Then *drum roll* DEMON SLAYER!!! Wow! What a terrible premise but the fans said ""iT gEtS bEtTeR fRoM hErE"" so I pushed through.\n\nFirst, we enter a generic training arc that only has animation (the blinded A LOT of people) as its redeeming factor. There is a part here that show how poor the storytelling of the show is. We see Tanjiro training with Sabito and Makomo. Shing shing sword fight then at the end, Tanjiro and Sabito had a clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8 final sword slash. Tanjiro appeared to cut the mask of Sabito but then few shots later the stone the he cannot cut at the earlier part of the arc was cut in half. It was revealed then that Sabito and Makomo are actually dead. So my question is all this time was the rock moving and having a sword fight with Tanjiro? Such a poorly written and told fight.\n\nThen it was revealed that Nezuko was sleeping all the time and apparently sleeping makes up for hunger. Ugh. Fucking wasted potential development. Instead of giving Nezuko internal struggles of suppressing hunger and developing her from there, we get this lazy ass writing that Sakonji used an off screen hypnosis so that Nezuko won\'t eat humans. Clap, clap, clap.\n\nDevelopment: Am I a joke to you?\n\nWe could have been shown clips of Nezuko eating animals to supress her hunger and at some point make a conflict between her and Tanjiro but no the author is lazy af. This could\'ve made her an interesting and compelling character but now she is just a cardboard of an character that is mostly used for cringe ass fanservice. nEzUkO kAwAiI.\n\nThen after the training arc, we go to the final selection. There we had the first villain, the green-giant-slime guy. Typical. Tanjiro was struggling at first then at the end he wins despite not being strong enough and what is worse is that the ones with Tanjiro also undergo almost the same or exactly the same amount of training as him. Nonsensical power scaling. But there is a larger problem here. While training, Tanjiro is shown to only use normal sword attacks but during the fight suddenly he can use Water Breathing attacks that are NOT shown during the training. Sure he was also practicing his actual breathing but how does it become a Water Breathing attack was never shown. So in other words, the techniques he use (from Breathing 1-10) are like asspulls. This show uses the training arc in the worst way possible.\n\nAfter that we had a few missions of Tanjiro and Nezuko fighting demons. After all those fights, the show tries to make you feel sad for the demons but the execution (at least to me) is so bad , especially with the drums demon. I jUsT wAnT sOmEoNe tO hEaR mE!!!, that instead of making me sad, it makes me laugh and cringe at the same time. Their flashbacks are to edgy for me. Like please, give your villains variety. Have a demon that is just a villain till the end. Don\'t make them all people with sad past. It gets tiring fast.\n\nEpisode 19 is trash. Its writing is Fairy Tail writing. ""Hinokami Kagura"" is one of the biggest asspulls of the year. Water user becoming able to use Fire (without training) in the verge of being killed is one of the worst moments of 2019. After Tanjiro ""beheading"" Rui, the author tries to make his failure weigh lighter so he made a Diabolus Ex Machina for Rui. He actually beheaded himself before Tanjiro can cut him so that it won\'t look like Fairy Tail. Wow so forced. Author-san if you think you got out of the shithole, NO! It just shows how poorly written this show is. Nezuko using Demon Arts despite sleeping 80% of the time and also without training is also an offender.\n\nI almost forgot the two horrendous main characters, Inosuke and Zenitsu. Two characters with little to no development and are just there for ""comedic"" relief but they are pure annoyances. Inosuke was just too bland for me to care so....meh but Zenitsu......He is easily one of the worst characters in 2019. His character is to be annoying. Shouting here, fainting there. Funny? HELL NO!! His power is pure Deus Ex Machina and is not ashamed to hide it.\n\nWe have better revenge stories out there like Vinland Saga, which is now my gold standard for revenge stories. The author knows what he wants to do. He makes Thorfinn look pathetic because he wants to get his message across to the viewers. Revenge is stupid and a waste of time. By Episode 22 of VS, this message was sent across perfectly. That scream from Thorfinn realizing he wasted years of his life for revenge was well done. Back to Kimestu no Yaiba, revenge here is taken in such a shallow way. Revenge is just an excuse for Tanjiro\'s fight with demons to have ""weight"" but it has little to none, at least to me.\n\nLike every 10/10 anime has flaws, a 1/10 anime also has positives. Kimetsu no Yaiba is no exception. The last episode (Muzan killing the lower moons) was actually pretty solid. That\'s it. Omegalul. Bye. Peace. Signing Out.\n\nAnything not mentioned, is either a clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8 moment that didn\'t really piss me off or a forgettable moment.\n\nWait. What the fuck is the purpose of making Muzan look gay?\n              '",Demon Slayer
ahjhj1717,"b'\n                What a waste of potential!\n\nStory:4 \nSo the plot is quite unique, sure, but why is the execution horrible? While using a fairly unique plot for a mainstream shounen, it all goes down the drain with the repetitive formula of ""crow comes, tells Tanjiro where to go, Tanjiro kills the demon, crow comes, tells him where to go, kills the demon"" and it goes on in this cycle.How can you say that the demons have been there for 5000 years and then go on to show the damn leader of the demons in the 7th episode. Demons since 5000 years would only mean that the demons\n                  ...\n          are widespread and quite self-explanatory about the world but the author really decided to mess that up and gave  by showing that the leader of the demons is in the same region/state/land as Tanjiro and that all the other 12 of the higher level demons are in the same state etc as Tanjiro as well it just doesn\'t add up. It\'s a big mess of a world building. This was such a waste of a unique plot that the author could come up with. For me PERSONALLY these kind of series heavily depend on the world building and the author wanted to I guess break that norm? Even the ""best"" part of the series had flaws although very much enjoyable, think about it? how was Tanjiro about to slice Rui\'s neck with a broken sword when just a minute before that his sword got sliced by his string.....STRINGS\n\nArt: 10\nOutstanding art no doubt about that. The animation in terms of movements doesn\'t come on the same level as Mob Psycho but the water from the sword and the flames and all those stuffs are unique and satisfying af\n\nSound: 9\nAmazing opening and a top class ost in the 19th episode. Tbh I enjoyed the Tanjiro vs Rui more because of the ost rather than the animation.\n\nCharacter: 4\nuh, ok. Tanjiro and Nezuko have a magnificent bond and their dynamics are fantastic. I only had a single problem with Tanjiro and that was empathy for the demons. The same demons that were ruthlessly slaughtering humans for who knows how many years and you\'re right there before them feeling for the .....demons? I do however appreciate the authors abilities to be able to get the feelings through to the viewers but this was just wasted by using it with the wrong characters and the wrong time why? why did Zenitsu have to be there? why did Inosuke have to be there? what\'s the point of them here? they\'re literally earrape. Zenitsu was definitely cool when he was asleep nut it\'s all overshadowed by his appalling comedy. Now demon slayer fans defend these two by saying they\'re comic relief but there\'s a place and time for that. Their fellow demon slayers just got slaughtered by the demons and Zenitsu is panicking doing his horrific comedy and there\'s Inosuke doing the Luffy\'s name pronunciation but failing with it. And the way he does it, the way they both do their comedy is just contradictory to its ""dark fantasy"" world.\n\nEnjoyment: 5\nNow this might\'ve been up to a 7 if the series didn\'t waste time in the ast 4-5 episodes. I also didn\'t enjoy the world building and a few inconsistenciesbut this could\'ve been overlooked. It were Zenitsu and Inosuke who were the real buzz killers . There really wasn\'t any need for them to be added along with a passionate character like Tanjiro honestly. I enjoyed the fight scenes and the ost  quite a lot.\n\nOverall: 6.4\n""Fair"" is what it gets. Animation sound fights  and the bond of Tanjiro and Nezuko keeps it on a safe 6 i guess. If anyone is considering watching it, then go ahead, you will enjoy it when the movie is about to come out because of hype and animation. It\'s a massive hit despite of its flaws so it won\'t be bad to check it out. If you\'re into fight scenes you can check it out. I personally recommend it for people to check out how to use an good OST with good animation. But if you\'re looking for something of a dark-fantasy, then stay away from this, I repeat, stay away!\n              '",Demon Slayer

H0henheim0fLight,"b""\n                I picked up this anime after I saw a review raving about its animation quality and creativity during fight scenes. This turned out to be incredibly true, and is good enough to keep my interest. However the incredible art is the only aspect that carries this anime and makes it enjoyable.\n\nThe story itself is a little bland, though that's not necessarily a bad thing for a straightforward Shounen. The show's biggest weakness lies in its immature attempts at humor. Specifically any scene involving Agatsuma Zenitsu will have him whine, scream, mope and cry. In an otherwise serious and mildly gory anime, these incongruous scenes get\n                  ...\n          overdone really quickly and will detract from your enjoyment. Of course other characters will serve as comedic relief from time to time, and those moments are quite more enjoyable.\n\nOverall this Shounen is definitively worth checking out if you value beautiful art styles or cool fight scenes. Its creative direction is a cut above most other Shounen you've seen. Just don't expect it to stand out in any other way.\n              """,Demon Slayer

ChristinoSim,"b""\n                I believe that, along with Attack On Titan, Demon Slayer is one of the all-time must-watch series. It really is not so good on the story part because it's quite simple: just kill the demons. But sometimes simplicity is a good thing. The main character, Tanjiro, is not a cliche main character and really cares for the people around him, including the demons. The characters are simple but great because Tanjiro and Nezuko are extremely kind and the evil characters are evil. Ubayashiki and the pillars are harsh on Tanjiro so he can improve. While much of the story is a bit boring and just\n                  ...\n          fighting, the animation and sound are great and it works well with the action-themed story. The thing that sets it apart from the rest of the action genre is that there are so many beautiful and calm settings in between the fights and after the fights. Each demon has their own story and, like Tanjiro, we can see where their motivation comes from and feel bad for them, even if the act of killing is unforgivable. It will give you goosebumps.\n\nNote: This review also applies to the Mugen Train movie and most likely the rest of the series when it comes out.\n              """,Demon Slayer
LemonadeSamurai,"b""\n                I'm sure you've heard it before but Demon Slayer really is that good. \n\nIt's arguably one of the best Shonen anime of the 21st century. \n\nThe story is set in 1800s Japan where a fictionalized group hunts demons plaguing Japan led by a Michael Jackson lookalike. The setting is a real world historical backdrop although it doesn't play a pivotal role. \n\nThe story follows a boy whose family was slaughtered by demons except for his younger sister Nezuko who was turned into one, he must protect Nezuko from other demon slayers as well as find the man who killed his family and exact revenge. \n\nWhat\n                  ...\n          is the main appeal of the show? Why is it so good? It's the characters and the animation. \n\nThe animation is GORGEOUS. It's very heavily shaded and just looks fantastic. The fight scenes are incredibly well done and a delight to watch. \n\nThe characters are very well written and develop though the course of the series. There's a total coward who can only use 1 special skill but is a complete beast at it and an overly masculine shirtless idiot with a feminine face who wears a boar mask and just wants to be the strongest. \n\nThe main character Tanjiro is a kind and innocent boy who has to become strong because he has to. \n\nThe show is filled with dark moments and all kinds of twists. There isn't any filler, its a straight path like in the manga. Like any Shonen there is humor sprinkled thoughout \n\nThe show does humor very well and some moments actually made me laugh out loud. \n\nThere are moments where you'll also cry. I won't spoil but there are deaths you won't see coming and moments that will actually shock you. \n\nThe sound is good and both the sub/dub are on equal standings. \n\nI'm almost 30 and I've rarely seen an anime or manga as well written and interesting as demon slayer. \n\nIt's just that good. It's even worth re-watching if you ask me.\n              """,Demon Slayer

akk05,"b'\n                Demon Slayer does a lot of things really well, and others not so much. It has great animation, great soundtrack, great voice acting, and great character designs. But everything else is just meh.\n\nIt\'s basically just a bunch of fights. One fight after another, with some training routines in the middle. And the fights, while animated really well, are definitely not the best. They all feel very one-sided for the main characters, despite them initially having a disadvantage. And that\'s because the demons don\'t really change. They repeatedly use the same boring attacks and get angry when Tanjirou or whoever dodges them. Some demons have really\n                  ...\n          interesting abilities, and yet you never see them use them to their full potential. All the main characters do is swing their swords, but the demons have actual abilities that could be used to make fights more interesting. Sadly, this isn\'t the case. Each fight is about the main characters overcoming the initial obstacle posed by the given demon\'s ability. While the main characters get boosts of confidence and power, the demons simply stay static. There is never a question of whether the demon will win. There is literally a fight where a demon stands 100% still and slaps some drums on his body. Thrilling. Whereas, the fights in Naruto for example are interesting because each side constantly finds new ways to attack their foe, by using their ability in a new way or by using different strategies. Furthermore, the demons are incredibly repetitive. To a point where it\'s a formula. Demon Slayer actually has the audacity to go in depth into each demon\'s backstory, but at the same time give each demon the most generic personality and motives. Every time Tanjirou kills a demon, the demon cries because apparently being killed by a nice guy is fulfilling. ""Oh, he didn\'t step on my writing. I can die in peace now!"". Or ""Oh, he loves his sister. How beautiful"". The demons either get frustrated when Tanjirou doesn\'t instantly die or are cocky all the way till the end. But the worst part about this is that we get a heartfelt and depressing backstory for each and every single demon, but we don\'t get so much as a mildly different personality or motive. It\'s like the audience is supposed to feel bad for a villain introduced five seconds ago who has 0 substance. For a show that is purely fighting demons, it would be nice to have a bit of variation. Many demons have a specific and aesthetically-pleasing character design that makes it look like they\'re either a main character or the final boss, which makes it even more disappointing when it turns out they just feel like eating humans.\n\nFinally, there\'s also a lack of attention to detail. It feels like all the effort\'s been put into the fights and none whatsoever into things actually making sense. The writer does not care about the world, the characters, the lore, and especially logic. There are often times where the reasoning behind something is unclear, or purely contradictory. Despite all this, it was enjoyable and overall quite high-quality (in terms of the anime adaptation).\n              '",Demon Slayer

The others are good. The music was forgettable. The sound effects were decent.\n\n\n\nCharacter: 5/10, a very imbalanced mix.\n\nThe main character, Tanjirou, is likable, very much so. His love for his family is apparent and that translates well into his visible devotion towards them.\nThe duality of his sister Nezuko made me root hard for her! I love her struggle and seeing her sometimes overcome it. She also has cute moments. She's my favorite.\nThe antagonist, Muzen, is shrouded in mystery. Yet, he seems powerful. Props to the show for managing both at the same time.\n\nThe rest of the cast is a big failure. Some characters are intended to be classic. Such as the lone trainer with an oni mask. However, the lack of both effort and creativity put into them makes them nothing more than a shadow of a trope.\nOn top of that, we're skimming through the various arcs of the series, not letting the viewer share enough time with the secondary cast to get attached to them. So, even if a character has an interesting potential, in the end it's not exploited enough to matter.\nAn example of that are non-manichean characters, whose alignment isn't clear. Especially not initially.\n\n\n\nStory: 2/10, a promising premise immediately cast aside.\n\nThe first episode made a big impression on me. I fell in love with it and instantly recommended the show.\n\nHowever, this anime pulled the single BIGGEST, RUDEST, most SHAMELESS bait & switch I have EVER bore witness to! Bar none!

I'm calm and collected, not exaggerating.\nWe're made to think Nezuko will have a predominant role and presence in the show. But she's forsaken as soon as episode 2 drops!

He either ran out of motivation or just was incapable of keeping it up.\n\n\n\nOverall: 1/10, appalling.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Yakima7,"b""\n                Demon Slayer starts off feeling like an ordinary shounen anime. We have the main character wanting to avenge his family's death while also wanting to cure his sister, he is going to do anything it takes to complete this goal. I think the main plot of Demon Slayer is pretty generic and simple, but there is something about this anime that I just think sticks out from other shounen anime.\n\nThe animation on this anime is outstanding, every single scene of this anime is beautifully made. The characters have unique styles which makes them more unforgettable and the battles scenes are really enjoying to watch because\n                  ...\n          they are just so incredibly well animated. I also found the sound quality to be extremly good, which also makes the battle scenes more awesome. The soundtrack and background music was also very good.\n\nWhat I really like about this anime is the characters, and they are also the reason why I think this anime differs from other shounen. The main character has that bravery and determined personality that is common among shounen main characters, but what I like about the main character in Demon Slayer is that he is a very sympethic person and very kind. I also like how he contain his cool during battles instead of being consumed of rage. There is also many other interesting characters that I would love to see more off.\n\nAnother thing I really like about Demon Slayer is how they portray the villains in the anime. Almost none of the villains feels completely evil, and you often feel bad for them, which makes them feel more realistic and human.\n\nI thought the first episodes of this anime felt a bit slow and uninteresting. I didn't really feel that invested in the characters, but after the first half of the anime I started to really enjoy watching it. I can't wait for a continuation of this anime and I hope it gets even better.\n              """,Demon Slayer
gonejellyfishin,"b'\n                As Faulkner once said, the only thing worth writing about is the human heart in conflict with itself. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba does not follow this advice for storytelling.\n\nUfotable\'s latest adaption is based on Koyoharu Gotouge\'s manga. The story follows a young boy, Tanjirou, who retains empathy for the monsters that massacred his family. This deconstruction of the self-righteous hero archetype throws questions at the audience about morality like ""is it right to seek revenge?"" But if you are expecting a Nietzschean treatment of good and evil - or any kind of emotional maturity for that matter - then Demon Slayer is not the\n                  ...\n          show for you. Spoilers ahead. \n\nThe story attempts to subvert the typical shonen cliches in its protagonist. Tanjirou displays a conscience, which is a surprisingly rare quality in an anime protagonist. The problem is the story remains driven by physical rather than psychological obstacles. This absence of internal conflict means Tanjirou\'s way of thinking is never challenged. Getting stronger to fight the bad guy of the week is the only thing that matters which, of course, ironically reverts the show back to the same generic shonen tropes it tries to escape from by making its protagonist different. In the end, Tanjirou becomes another boring, one-dimensional shonen hero, rather than a morally conflicted, realistic character who must balance his desire for revenge and pacifism.\n\nEveryone loves heroes but they still have to be relatable on some level. Their heroism has to feel earned. No one really cared about Superman until DC writers developed Clark Kent, making him fallible and human. We never get that with Tanjirou. After the prologue, a way to empathise with him might have been to examine the psychological effects of tragedy. Demon Slayer could have been about the theme of forgiveness. But Tanjirou is never in danger of becoming like the monsters he fights, so it doesn\'t feel meaningful when he chooses not to kill them. There\'s no catharsis or meaningful moment when he is forced to kill either, it just sort of happens.\n\nThere is so much wasted potential here. The premise of a reluctant hero pushed to his mental limits, along with the Taisho-era setting are not utilised. As far as I can tell, the only discernible reason for Nezuko\'s existence is to cheer Tanjirou on like a cute mascot. I kept waiting for the siblings\' relationship to be explored in more than just head pats and chibi-Nezuko moments. Early on, we are introduced to a potentially interesting plot point in her condition. For a moment, the stakes were raised. I wondered what would happen if she loses control?  What kind of guilt would Tanjirou feel in that situation, if mercy to his sister led to the death of innocents? What kind of difficult choices would he have to make? I was emotionally torn by the idea. But then, like everything else in Demon Slayer, Nezuko\'s problem magically solved itself, preventing the characters from having to make any decision at all. She just goes to sleep for a bit, and now she\'s a good demon.\n\nSince my problems mainly lie with the story, I guess I wouldn\'t recommend the manga either. Conclusion: The most overrated show of 2019.\n              '",Demon Slayer

shadow0130,"b'\n                If you like BNHA and/or FMA then you\'ll probably like this show too. Why? Because it\'s just the same generic shounen anime but with different themes.\n\nStory: Antagonist who\'s bad for the sake of being bad need to be defeated by protag to protect the world. That\'s the gist of it. While there was an underlying motive of revenge, it\'s completely buried by the sense of duty the protag has to protect other people. There was also the ""I\'m fighting for my family"" spiel that give the protag the power to beat the bad guys. Overall it\'s just so generic and bland.\n\nArt: Just generic art overall\n                  ...\n          with a few exceptions. The animation quality is top notch, as to be expected with Ufotable. One might even say that the only thing the show has going for it was the animation. Overall it\'s pretty good from an animation standpoint\n\nSound: I don\'t really know much about the sound cause I don\'t care much for the sound and music themes.\n\nCharacter:(Spoilers I think) The only character I really liked in this show was Shinobu, who was the strong but airhead character (like Shizuku Murasaki). Nezuko was also good but I can\'t really say I liked her because of her character. Other than that almost everyone was irredeemably bad. Tanjiro was just a standard bland protagonist (like Midoriya). Inosuke was just angry all the time for no reason at all (like Bakugo). Zenitsu was just a wimpy dude (like Usopp but worse cause Usopp was actually a good character). Overall the characters are worse than in BNHA.\n\nEnjoyment: Again the only reason I watched it to the end was cause the animation was so good. Other than that it\'s just boring. The jokes and tropes were bland, the fight scenes were lackluster, you can\'t connect with any of the characters. \n\nOverall: I watched caused they said it\'s good, and I stayed cause of the animation. 3/10\n              '",Demon Slayer
RenjiVs,"b""\n                I'd like to start off by saying that if you genuinely think that this anime deserves the amount of hype and attention that it recieved you may have a bit more than a screw loose in your head. This anime is disgustingly average, made clearly to appeal to the more edgy shounen fanbase who want to seem more mature as they are into violence - basically your standard 12 year old tokyo ghoul fan. \nFirstly, the concept is really not anything special, a combination of your regular man eating monster shtick, combined with an overused, boring sword-wielding MC, definetely something new and original. \nSpeaking of\n                  ...\n          original, let's talk about the power system. Firstly it doesn't make sense to me how anybody thinks this is cool, especially considering this is part of the shounen genre - the power system should have been must more interesting, instead of some stupid breathing technique. Despite how bland the power system was, it did seem to have originality on its side - or so I thought, until i watched JoJo's bizarre adventure part 1 and realized that the power system was completely plagarised from JJBA. So, all in all the power system has absolutely nothing going for it, adding to the growing list of reasons why this anime is average at best. \nNow, onto the characters. The main character is your standard feminine coward of an MC that somehow manages to fight his way through villains due to massive power ups and the help of his nakama, reminiscent of Mirai Nikki's Yukiteru - again very original. As a character himself, despite receiving a fair amount of development he seems awfully similar to deku(just with less tears) on top the same boring cliche of dead family and revenge repeated an endless amount of times - not only in shounen anime but the entertainment industry as a whole - once again - ORIGINAL. \nThe art and animation were admittedly the one factor of this anime that i would say actually deserved the hype they received, they were pulled off very nicely, the fight scenes were pleasing to watch - despite weak choreography. \nAll in all, i see no reason why this anime has any more appeal than any other standard shounen anime, there is nothing - apart from the art that works in its favour to make it any better. \n\nART - 8 \nSTORY - 5 \nCHARACTERS - 3 \nENJOYMENT - 4\n              """,Demon Slayer
catz4lifez,"b'\n                *CONTAINS SPOILERS* (it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s really long sorry) *MANGA SPOILERS TO*\n\nDemon Slayer has to be one of my favorite animes. The characters especially, the music, storyline and overall development is something I really enjoyed. \n\nFirst, let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s talk about the characters. The three main characters have interesting background, you just have to read the manga. Tanjiro might seem like that typical \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93hero\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd of a story or protagonist but he goes deeper than that. He might be similar to many other protagonists but he had distinct features that set him apart from others. For example, the fact that we know noting/ some things about some feature he has, his\n                  ...\n          earrings/scar for example are still mysteries if you just watched the first season, he might be kind hearted but his motives are not so kind hearted. One of them is revenge but deeper down he also wants to protect what\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s dear to him and others, human lives.  Now onto Inosuke, he might seem like an annoying type character  when you first see him, but as the story progressed, Inosuke became more than that, we see his skills in action and that fact that he never backs down from a fight. Inosuke also becomes more kind hearted towards Tanjiro as the story goes on, showing his charcter development, since, in the beginning he disliked him. Finally Zenitsu to be honest, I find his crying and outburst of screaming is funny. I feel like people can relate to Zenitsu as he is a character that most of us would be if we were in this world. Also, the fact that Zenitsu is more powerful when he sleeps is great development, you wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t typically expect for a main character to be scared like that to. Nezuko isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t a major character in my eyes but she is a good part to the story. The fact that she is always there to help her brother creates this feeling it adds the love they feel for each other (SIBLING LOVE) Nezuko also not eating humans adds development to her character, it shows us that she can fight as a \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Demon Slayer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd though she is a demon herself. \n\n(Sorry there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a lot of character stuff)\nThe Harshira have some of my favorite characters in the whole entire show. Each of them has a unique design and breathing style. The don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t get enough screen time in the show, but in the manga, you can really see the full extent of there powers. The nine pillars are some of the most amazing people in the show that are labeled side characters. They each have \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93their own\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd arcs that is shared. I also wanted to mention them because many reviews I have seen don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t typically mention them since there screen time is low.\n\nMoving on to the battles, I believe that demon slayer has some of the best battles out there. The battles between the Upper and Lower moons especially. For example, during the second season, Uzui Tengen\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s battle with the Upper Moon Six had me in the edge of my seat the whole time. The intense ness  of the battle was heart reaching, and the speed was also incredible. \nThe battles in DS also can profe that the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93good guys\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t always win every battle. For example, Rengoku and Shinbou both die in the show/manga. There deaths can show that the DS\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2S don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t always win against the enemies they face. Rengoku\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s and Akaza battle was intense as well, it had me on the edge of my seat, I seriously didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t expect Rengoku to die. They use a lot of shock factor and plot twisters during the battles make you want to keep watching.\n\n\nNow to the Arcs. I believe that all the arcs are amazing in there own right, my tow favorites would have to be the Entertainment District Arc and the Mountain one with the spider demon family. The fact that the Arcs both incorporated different Hashiras made them even better. They didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t just include Shinbou or Giyuu but they incorporated Tengen in as well, making the Arcs just that much better. Each arc is unqie  in there own way, they can show the development of each character and the plot line.\n\nNow to the demons + animation. The demons backstory\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s makes you feel actually sorry for them. The demons showed in the show can be catogized as major demons and lesser demons. The demons that are major usually last longer and the lesser ones die more quickly and only take about one episode to kill off. I personally think that adding the backstories of the demons that we all used to hate makes you feel sympathy for them to the point where you wish they could have been humans or they could have not eaten people like Nezuko. My personal favorite Demon was Rui and his mother. \nAnimation from this show is beyond amazing, the animation is a major part of the show and this especially goes for the second season. The way the fire in the second season is drawn and portrayed  is just amazing, you could almost belive is that the fire was truly real. The animation during any of the battles was amaze and really portrayed the seriousness of each battle. I also liked the water graphics when it came to Giyu\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Water Breathing Technique known as \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Dead Calm\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd I thought that it was fabulous.\n\nThe music for each season was amazing as well. The art, official or not was amazing and it really showed the true character designs. For example, demon slayers overall art style is really unique and extremely pretty. The official Covers for each series are detailed, and amazingly pretty. \n\nI seriously enjoyed this show and I believe everyone should at least watch 10 episodes ti really understand the story line. \n\nStory-9\nArt-10\nSound-10\nCharacter-8\nEnjoyment-10\nOverall-10\n              '",Demon Slayer
Marinate1016,"b""\n                Shounen done right. The best of the genre.\n\nKimetsu No Yaiba is a series I have been waiting a long time for. I have been following the manga for the past few years now and was really excited when I found out it would be getting an anime adaption by Ufotable. Like the story, the first few episodes start out pretty slow, laying the groundwork for the amazing scenes/battles to come. But, once KNY gets going, it gets fucking going. There's absolutely gorgeous animation, honestly top 5 animated series I have ever seen. The music is impeccable, OP by LiSa is a regular in my daily\n                  ...\n          music rotation, character designs are unique and actually pretty damn accurate for the Taisho era. Fights are done in breathtaking detail with a mix of hand drawn animation and CGI. Plot is original, fresh and not too overwhelming. \n\nHonestly, this is the perfect shounen. It's got everything you could want. Action, Music, Quality Animation, fast paced, etc. Episode 19 catapulted the series into unimaginable heights and while I am glad that it is getting more attention, I also kinda miss it being a niche series. That said, Kimetsu No Yaiba is not only one of the easiest 10s I have ever given, but also my choice for Anime of the Year. Been saying it for months and now others are finally listening. Watch it and make your own choice.\n              """,Demon Slayer
HaremRoute,"b'\n                This, my friends, is the best Touhou anime I\'ve never seen!\n\nBut ok, jokes aside, this anime is more beautiful than I\'ve expected. No amount of trailers will give it enough justice in that regard.\nI love the thick lines, so it\'s very much up my alley. The animation is simply outstanding. A lot of interesting decisions, like, for example, sometimes it goes first-person for extra immersion. You get used to CGI very fast. It has fantastic, original effects, beautiful intermissions, really creepy demon designs and characters that look unique.\nThere is blood and gore, which is good. Limbs fly around quite often and blood sprays even more\n                  ...\n          so. Characters don\'t mind though, they just brush it off without as much as a scream and keep fighting. Oh well... that\'s just genre conventions.\nSome things, however, are censored. Which is weird. Because sometimes censorship is there and sometimes isn\'t. I just don\'t know how they decided what warrants it. That said, when it\'s there, it\'s still stylish.\nSo, visually, this anime is absolutely amazing, one of the best I\'ve ever seen, no doubt.\n\nThe composer is Yuki Kajiura, so... to no one\'s surprise, the soundtrack will give you goosebumps because of how breathtakingly atmospheric it is. Nothing else to add here. Masterpiece.\n\nThe episodes are a little empty. It\'s like nothing has happened yet, and it already ended. And that ending is often abrupt, with no cliffhanger or a defined ending scene. I would honestly go crazy if I was watching it as an ongoing instead of binging. \nBesides, at this point I\'m so used to great anime that don\'t waste time on typical ""previously on..."" scenes that just the fact that they were present in Kimetsu no Yaiba was disheartening. I was just sitting there thinking ""why did you just waste two and a half minutes?""\n\nNow to the juicy part, story and dialogues. \n\nOh boy... \nThey were so poor, I\'m not sure words I want to use to describe them will be approved by moderators.\nAnd I really can\'t explain how infuriatingly dumb they are without going into spoilers, but let\'s just say I can rant about them for hours and it will get heated, because I hate them THAT much.\nI\'ll give you one example. One dialogue without context, so it\'s not much of a spoiler, but if you don\'t want even that much, just skip the next paragraph.\n\nSo, one character asks another what year it is. Assuming that he has lost count of time at this point. He didn\'t get the answer besides the fact that the era has changed (meaning it is a different emperor on the throne now). No dates. Not way of knowing how many emperors have changed. Nothing. And so, literally in the next line he starts saying: ""I will never forget that day, 47 years ago..."" \nSeriously? SERIOUSLY? I mean, come on, this is an extremely amateurish mistake.\n\nThere is a lot of exposition and not of a fun variety, just stupid. Explanations like ""this sword is made of special metal"", ""this clothing is made of special cloth"", ""this mask is protected by special charms"" - this all sounds like a kindergartner wrote the story.\n\nThere are just too many things like this. Writing in this anime is offensively stupid.\n\nHumor... well... let\'s just say, it\'s the same as the rest of the writing. Stupid. And if in the first few episodes it looks kinda cute, later it just becomes annoying. At one point I just started skipping their comedic routine to get back to the main story, because I understood that if I struggled through one more scene like that I just won\'t be able to finish this anime. It\'s really that bad.\n\nThe characters are one-dimensional and don\'t go beyond one personality quirk.\n   Tanjiro, the protagonist, is weirdly enough the best of the bunch. He is not your typical shonen hero. He doesn\'t scream, doesn\'t rush and he\'s very kind. But it\'s not a stupid type of kindness that stands between him and his mission. It doesn\'t look phony at all, but instead creates some of the most emotional moments in the series. I also love the way he talks to kids. He manages to make child characters way less annoying than they usually are.\n   Nezuko... exists. And that makes internet happy. I mean... it makes me happy too. But doesn\'t make her a good character at all. She has about zero development. But she\'s undeniably cute. Also, please, put something soft into her box, I just don\'t want to think how much it hurts inside with all the running, jumping, spinning, swimming that Tanjiro does.\n   The antagonist is... described by one of the characters the best - he is a coward. And, to be honest, he is quite pathetic. Which makes watching him a really dull experience.\n   Shinobu is great. I need way more battles with her. I want to know if there are any to be expected from season 2, because this could be the deciding factor in whether I\'ll watch it or not. She\'s just that cool.\n   And then Zenitsu happened. And... I\'ll be honest, I almost dropped this anime the moment he opened his mouth. His level of annoyance is at the level of the worst One-Piece characters. And I\'m saying this as a person who actually enjoys One-Piece. Stupid, loud, whiny comedic relief.\nSure, he has his moments. In fact, I\'ll go as far as to say he has some of the most epic moments in this anime. But they are way too few to tolerate him all the other time. Which is a shame because he was the character I was most looking forward to the moment I saw his design.\n   Finally, while I mostly found Inosuke annoying, I just have to give props to his voice actor. He was so good with all the screaming I couldn\'t believe when I saw his name. It\'s the same guy who voiced protagonists of Sword Art Online and Danmachi. Like... holy hell... I\'m impressed, I would\'ve never guessed it was him. Bravo! I think I found my new favorite male voice actor. \n\nIn the end, Kimetsu no Yaiba is an empty show in a gorgeous wrapper. Because of that wrapper and the main idea behind the show, I managed to watch it to the end (of the first season). But at one point it became such a painful experience because of the whole stupidity of dialogues and story, that I couldn\'t recommend it to anyone else in good faith.\nThe writer\'s skill was so poor that it didn\'t just become an average show with some plot holes and tropes you can forgive. It actively worked against everything this show was doing right. You can see that she (writer) had amazing ideas, but lacked the talent to put them together. These ideas - points A, B, C in the story - are marvelous. But everything between is just atrocious. Sometimes you\'re watching a moment of unmatched beauty, both visually and emotionally, and are thinking - there it is, fantastic, gorgeous, breathtaking! And everything in that moment of silent visual storytelling is clear without words... but then the moment keeps dragging, they add words: start talking about exposition, backstory, put a completely unnecessary comment from the heroes. And all you can do is sit there and think: ""No, please, stop, not now, it was so perfect""... But alas, the moment is gone.\nAnd this is what ruined Kimetsu no Yaiba for me. And I\'m just upset that such a potential was ruined. By lack of talent or just lack of experience - it doesn\'t matter.\nThe writing quality killed this anime.\n              '",Demon Slayer

I guess there were some episodes where other characters besides the main one Tanjirou had their pasts explained. OST was worth listening to. I think even non-Shonen fans might enjoy this show.

bladerv,"b""\n                Generic, overrated anime that is ranked higher than better shows it does not deserve such high ratings IMO, let's go. \n\nFirst, the story is average at best with demons killing humans yet our idiot MC doesn't believe it's true. Also every great story needs a great villain and this has none of that, all cliche big bad demons just because. So many generic moments too when MC does something in the story you expect him to do, so predictable and poorly written you can tell what's gonna happen where's the fun in that. \n\nThe characters are dull and boring as hell to watch it's like\n                  ...\n          watching paint dry with the way Tanjiro our MC interacts with others always like a teacher's pet. The MC trains, gets strong and uses technique never seen before and wins against demons he really shouldn't alone. So believable right. \n\nEnjoyment - Not even one episode that's completely enjoyable especially the first 5 episodes, every episode I'm checking the watch hoping for it to end. Generic anime  doesn't mean it's bad but this anime is. For example: Hero Academia is actually enjoyable and fun to watch since you're invested in the characters, Demon slayer fails at that spectacularly with stupid jokes and characters that don't matter.\n\nAnimation - Great, without it nobody would hold it to such a high level but it's a pity that other great anime with good stories suffer from animation budget yet this \ngets great animation.\n\nOverall -\nAnimation is great for action scenes being incredibly beautiful but it's all style and no substance as there are other great shounen anime that has both. \n\nEdit- actually just watched it during my holiday in TV and well, it's not bad even though the tropes and cliches are there it's fine. Maybe I was too harsh before lol definitely had low expectation, but it's fine and enjoyable so far\n              """,Demon Slayer
umarudesuwa,"b""\n                Alrighty, my first ever review. After consuming right about 60 days worth of anime, I finally ended up feeling the need to write a review. Why now? Why this show? Well, I felt I had to. This show is very interesting in a way to me, in the sense that it does a number of things really well, but a plethora of things outstandingly terrible. But let's get down to the nitty gritty. This review will contain some spoilers in order to support some of my points.\n\nLet's begin with the great elements: The animation. The animation is honestly gorgeous. I don't need to tell you\n                  ...\n          how good the 2D animation in the show is, it speaks for itself. What I do need to talk about is the blending of 2D and 3D. I was told that some of the CGI would not blend in that well with the 2D in the show, but I disagree completely. This show does this blend extremely well, the action scenes float so naturally as we one screen setup jump from 2D to 3D and back again in the next screen setup in order to create extremely dynamic camera angles. I would honestly say that the untrained eye would miss most of the 3D used, since it is so seamless.\n\nSimilarly, the beginning of the story is executed quite well IMO. They don't exactly reinvent the wheel, a shonen protagonist loses their family in order to start their journey, but what I think really worked for me here was the very nonchalant way Tanjiro interacts with his family before the incident occurs. It doesn't try to hammer down our throats how much he loves his family and how much his siblings love him. Neither it is too vague to care about. It hits a nice balanced where it feels organic to me.\n\nNext up, the power system! I like the system used in this show. There is devoted a good amount of time to establish and showcase how it works, and it feels relatively grounded, as it's just breathing.\n\nI think that about covers it for the good parts, time to be negative :(.\n\nThe comedy in this show sucks and is causing immense amounts of mood problems. There is a huge issue with the type of comedy which the show tries to employ and it really hurts quite a few scenes in which the serious tone is just eviscerated by some of the god awful running gags in the show. I'm talking scenes where we have Inosuke in the background of a serious conversation running into a tree repeatedly. I'm talking Zenitsu yelling about how he is going to die and how he doesn't want to die even though he isn't proactively trying to avoid dying. And I'm talking interrupting the rehabilitation and spending a good 2 minutes of screen time for Zenitsu to tell the other 2 guys that they aren't allowed to complain about the training being hard because there are women present... The comedy boils down to some awful running gags as well as some out of the blue loud reactions and yelling, because LOL RANDOM.\n\nThis leads me to the characters. They are not good... most of them have one trait which isn't that uncommon for a shonen show to use minimalistic characters, however most of the characters in this show is used solely for either a running gag or looking and being menacing. The few characters that aren't cutboards does sadly not pick up the slack. Tanjiro starts out as a likable hero, but rapidly falls into a pit of a way too pure moral compass that usually interferes with his common sense and over the course of the show he devolves into a boring flavorless goody 2 shoes. Inosuke yells a lot and it gets pretty stale rather quickly. His badass look and fierce demeanor doesn't really make up for the fact that he is just a loud idiot. Speaking of loud idiots, Zenitsu is possibly one of the most unlikable characters I've ever seen. He yells, he cries, he cower and then he yells some more. He is secretly very strong and badass when in a trance-like state, which for some reason is supposed to make up for the other 90% of his screen time where he is so unbearable that it makes me wanna stab out my eye sockets as well as my ears, so I don't have to look or listen to him anymore, which if you couldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t guess it, does not make up for it. I was overwhelmed with joy as he was laying on a tree limb about to die from poison, but alas he lived and my hope died instead. I did enjoy our big villain though. There was a bit of mystery around him, but we got to see glimpses of who he is and why he does what he does, which I think really added to him as a character and made him feel rounded. The last one I want to address is Nezuko. She is... kinda just there. She is cute at times and she had that semi cool moment against that ball demon and that's about it. She can shrink in size to suit her mood, but with a skip and a hop she is not one cool kong :/ .\n\nAnd up next is the structure and pacing of the show. The pacing is decent in the first 6 or 7 episodes. We get a good balanced of action, exposition and story. After this point, however, the pacing dives faster than Hans Hass and episodes gets flooded with an enormous amount of filler. Many of the otherwise great fight scenes gets plagued with a lot of waiting. We see Tanjiro fumbling around the fight not using any of the techniques he has trained to use for these types of situations, get injured and then right before he is done for, he uses one of the techniques and kills the demon. Then we get a good 10 minutes of back story for the demon that died, which might have had more impact if we knew it before he died, since now we don't care.. he's dead. The structure is weird. Halfway through the show it turns into what can best be described as an episode template from a bad season of the walking dead. The episodes in this portion of the show usually plays out this exact way every time: rerunning the final 3 minutes of the previous episode(not recap, the exact same footage), then a brief resolution of the conflict, 3-6 minutes of nothing happening, a slight build to something happening, another 3-6 minutes of nothing happening and then a cliffhanger ending so you have to watch the next episode, but fuck you because not only does the momentum gets derailed by seeing the same footage again, but after a quick resolution it's back to boredom city with you. The combination of this pacing as well as the structure makes it nearly impossible to stay engaged for a full 20 minutes, even when some of the action scenes are really dope.\n\nIf I'm being honest you could probably teach a master class on how not to tell and build a story from this show, there are so many fundamental elements of story telling that it fails to execute correctly.\n\nLastly, why did we need a moment in which Tanjiro conveniently remembers that his father in Tanjiro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s childhood used a breathing technique far superior to the one he has been trained in... like the levels of deus ex machina here are astronomical.\n\nOverall I think 3 is fair score when considering all the aspects of the show which drags it down. I'm a firm believer in the idea that no amount of visuals or animation can safe a show that is extremely flawed in the characters and story department, and thus I don't consider the animation a redeeming quality if that is the majority of what a show has to offer.\n              """,Demon Slayer

zdodo,"b""\n                Demon slayer is an anime considered a masterpiece by many watchers of this anime, but in reality the story of demon slayer is very simple. So, why it is one of the most popular animes? \n\nStory - 5\n\nThe plot is based in Tanjiro Kamado, a 16-year-old boy, the protagonist of the anime. A smart, kind and hard-working boy who used to live happily with his mother and 7 siblings, earning money by selling coal, just like his late father. However, one day when he returned home, he found that his family had been attacked by demons and the only survivor of the attack was his\n                  ...\n          younger sister, nezuko, who had become a demon, but surprisingly she still showed signs of emotions and human thoughts. With the event, tanjiro decides to become a demon slayer and protect people from this happening to them, while he seeks a way to make nezuko human again.\n\nAnimation - 9\n\nI have nothing to complain about the demon slayer animation, it's something really fantastic, one of the reasons why the anime is so famous, ufotable really took care of it.\n\nSoundtrack - 8\n\nI think the soundtrack matches the atmosphere of the anime a lot, it gives a suspense that matches the characters and setting of the anime. you can feel the scene, it's something really incredible.\n\nCharachters - 4\n\nDemon slayer characters are rather bland and characterless. Tanjiro is a typical shonen protagonist, persistent and friendly. nezuko is just cute, nothing more special. Inosuke is loud and obnoxious who just fights and tries to work things out the hard way. zenitsu is annoying, he keeps screaming the whole anime. Tomioka is a cold character and helped tanjiro with his sister, protecting them. And Shinobu, I actually like her background history, but it would be a more interesting character if she wasn't undervalued, being weak compared to the other pillars.\n\nOverall - 6\n\nAfter all I think demon slayer is a fine anime, but not as good as the fans say. Like, it was a very hyped anime so everyone started talking about it and they thought it was the perfect anime, but it's not all that they say.\n              """,Demon Slayer
idkCookie,"b""\n                *Minor spoilers*\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba, or Demon Slayer, is one of the most successful shows in the past years if not decades, but it also seems to do most things worse than typical shonen shows. In the end, you only truly enjoy watching Demon Slayer if you can completely shut down your brain and only pay attention to the pretty art and animation. If you ever have any plot questions while watching, they probably won't be answered. Which brings me to my first point: the plot.\n\nThe plot is truly horrendous; I pray that no one will ever finish this season and say that it is well\n                  ...\n          written. Prepare to die with questions such as why do demons exist?, why does Nezuko not need blood?, why can Sankonji do literal hypnosis/mind control on a demon without anybody ever mentioning it again?, why do the demon slayers not wear body armor?, and more.\n\nBesides that, Demon Slayer skips what is usually a good part of shonen stories: a training arc. While I don't expect heaps of training episodes, I would've enjoyed watching Tanjiro do more than run up and down a mountain for several minutes. I mean, everybody is fighting with swords in this show, but we never really see Tanjiro learn how to fight or anything. Instead, we get the very engaging and super super interesting breathing training because as anybody knows, in a show about people with superhuman skills like lightning and flame who use expert swordsmanship skills to defeat terrifying demons, we all want to see the main characters practice breathing techniques.\n\nOn top of that, the characters in Demon Slayer are beyond terrible. Each of the main characters are a caricature and mainly boring. Tanjiro is the stereotypical shonen protagonist who suffered a terrible loss and he works hard to become strong while being a kind and considerate boy. There isn't a single ounce of nuance or complexity in his character, and he's only interesting to watch when he's fighting. I don't even need to elaborate on Zenitsu; all he really does is whine and complain, and he quickly becomes annoying to watch. And of course, Inosuke, the very hot headed, short tempered, stubborn, and battle hungry member of the trio. What is his goal? To fight people I guess. What a well written character.\n\nI will admit that it is enjoyable at times to watch (mainly when the characters are just fighting, which, thankfully, is most of the episodes). The art is beautifully drawn, and the animation is stunning, but of course, everybody knows that at this point. All the amazingly made art and stunning fight scenes can't make up for the bad storyline and characters. The only person in this season whose goals I completely understand is Tanjiro.\n\nTLDR; Watch the fight scenes on youtube instead, and don't watch this badly written show.\n              """,Demon Slayer

Gensouori,"b'\n                I will first start out with a quote from a very certain person to describe this anime known as Kimetsu no Yaiba... ""Demon Slayer boils down to just demon of the week"" \n\nI was hyped for Demon Slayer much like everyone else was, the animation was great, especially in that now famous episode 19, which obviously blew up, but, of course, I don\'t remember a damn thing about the anime other than the fights, which were obviously the most vocal. The story...if you can even call it that, is completely forgettable, hell, all I remember is just that Tanjiro needs to kill whatever demon turned\n                  ...\n          his sister into a damn demon, I don\'t remember the name, but regardless.\n\nStory 3 out of 10\n\nAs I said, the \'story\' is completely forgettable, hardly anything was worth remembering, nor do I remember anything about it...so I can\'t really explain much of what I dislike, and I do not want to experience it again.\n\nArt 6 out of 10\n\nThe art was actually pretty decent, it\'s not my favorite, but I praise it\'s unique sense of style, especially in the visual effects, like fire and water.\n\nSound 8 out of 10\n\nDear me, besides the fight scenes, this was my favorite part about the anime, the sound is almost perfect in some of the scenes...it\'s what gave me goose bumps!\n\nCharacter 3 out of 10\n\nI\'m sure if you\'ve seen the anime...you know why the character is this low...because there isn\'t any!\n\nEnjoyment 7 out of 10\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba was a adventure to say the least, it\'s a very okay show, but it\'s not worth remembering outside of it\'s fight scenes, which I am sure everyone will remember.\n\nAnd my final rating for Kimetsu no Yaiba is...a 5 out of 10. All in all, it\'s a decent show.\n              '",Demon Slayer

No, but it is close to it.\nMost of the characters, have interesting backstories, are funny and have their distinct quirks, not your basic and usual shounen characters. \nBut what really sets this show apart from other shounen is, of course, Nezuko, the cute and adorable main protagonist sister.

VVayfarer,"b""\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba features pretty art and an interesting setting, but that's about it. \n\nThe main characters feel lifeless and shallow. They have no dreams, and their interactions are awkward at best. Imagine a group of weird-but-uninteresting people who don't really like each other but who are forced to work together as a team. That's the dynamic you can expect from the characters in Demon Slayer.\n\nThe side characters are even worse. Many of them don't seem real at all. I don't think the author cared about them, as zero effort seems to have been put into developing their thought processes, value systems or worldviews. They\n                  ...\n          come off as if they're playing a role; everything about them seems artificial.\n\nThe comedy feels cartoony. If you find characters slipping on banana peels funny, I believe you might enjoy the humor in this show. \n\nThe story feels uninspired. It's a repetition of 1) the party meets a new oni and decides to defeat it because it's evil 2) the oni turns out to be strong 3) the party defeats the oni with 30% strategy + 70% deus ex machina 4) as the oni is about to die, we see a flashback of its tragic (very cliche) lifestory 5) we learn a bit more about the main villain / a possible cure for the sister 6) rinse and repeat.\n\nThe main villain (or what seems to be the main villain) is powerful, but not very intimidating, interesting or badass in any way or form. The same applies to minor villains. This was a letdown for me, as I really enjoy deep, well-written villains, often more so than well-written heroes. For reference, I personally like the central antagonists in FSN (the 2004 game version) Ace of the Diamond, One Piece, Code Geass, the Trails games, Metal Gear games, etc.\n\nThe music is good, but I really think the studio should hire a new sound director. Every now and then his choice of BGM doesn't seem to fit the mood at all (e.g. he might have an epic, beautiful track play during a very mundane scene), which felt mildly distracting.\n\nConclusion: the anime has some minimal entertainment value if you're willing to ignore its faults. I doubt I'll watch the sequel.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nStory: 3/10\nCharacters: 3/10\nMusic: 5/10\nArt: 6/10\nEnjoyment: 4/10\nOverall: 4/10\n              """,Demon Slayer

zbunj,"b""\n                I've never written a review before but after watching this show I simply had to write about it somewhere.\nTo put it simply: you will enjoy Demon slayer if you're only looking for pretty art, good animation and great fight scenes. If you want a good story and characters you shouldn't watch this.\nAfter seeing how hyped up the show got I had to watch it. Do I feel like my time watching it was wasted? No. But I also feel like I could've spent it watching something a lot better.\nI won't talk about the art and animation because I think it's pretty clear both are fantastic.\n                  ...\n          I am going to criticize everything I had a problem with:\n\n1. Characters\nThe shows biggest flaw are it's characters.  The character designs are great but that's where the good things end. They are simply flat,boring and could be described with a word or two. Tanjiro has to be one of the worst protagonists I've ever seen. He is literally too perfect. He is cares deeply for his family, he's intelligent, has empathy for everyone(even murderous demons), he's hardworking,etc. The problem is that he doesn't posses a single flaw. When it comes to other characters they aren't any better. Zenitsu is annoying and his screaming and constant crying are supposed to be funny but only a small child could possibly laugh at his antics. I refuse to acknowledge Nezuko as a character at all because she has no personality and is only there to be cute and to save Tanjiro whenever it's convenient for the plot. Inosuke is probably my favorite out of the main four. He isn't great but I found him at least a little bit entertaining compared to the others. When it comes to the main villain of the story, he is very basic. The whole show is treating it's characters like black and white. (in the sense that a character is either purely good or purely bad). The characters either have flaws or positive traits, having both simply isn't allowed. The other characters in the show, besides their visual design, are really forgettable.\n\n2.Story\nIt's pretty basic and honestly that isn't a problem. I, and I'm sure a lot of people, can get down with a basic story. A lot of times it feels nostalgic watching a show with a familiar type of plot. However, because Demon slayer lacks in characters there is nothing to carry the plot well.\n\n3.Humor\nI don't even know if it can even be called that. The jokes are,again,something a child would laugh at. If a show has a 17+ label on it, it shouldn't be there only because of blood/gore/explicit content,it should also be there because you're assuming adults will watch this. So why aren't you treating your audience like adults? Both the characters personalities and humor is something that could easily be put in a children's show and that's a problem.\n\n4.World building\nNon existent. At the start of the show you probably believed that this anime took place in an era/world where currently there aren't any/many big advancements in terms of transport or modern devices. However this isn't true because there are literal big cities,trains,etc. shown later on. The problem is that we never got a proper sense of what time period this was supposed to be going on. Another problem is that somehow people who live in cities and the police are unaware of the existence of demons or refuse to acknowledge them. I don't know who thought that that sort of explanation makes any sense, because it doesn't. We know that there are demons who live in cities and honestly since demons represent such a huge threat in this world you can't possibly make me believe that none of those city folk know about them and that the police just blatantly ignores them. It's honestly ridiculous and it's a poor excuse for the reason demons weren't destroyed by now(or the majority of them).\n\nI think that should be all. Aside from these 4 main points there are other things I have issues with such as the existence of a lot of smaller inconsistencies or plot conveniences but I won't get into them due to spoilers. In the end, if you find enjoyment in this show that's great, I found some enjoyment in it as well. However I had to acknowledge all of my issues with it. That's all.\n              """,Demon Slayer

NiQzu,"b'\n                Kimetsu no Yaiba, also known as Demon Slayer is fairly balanced of emotional storytelling, also including cool and funny moments of the main protagonist.\n\n\n\n[SPOILERS]\nThe story revolves around feelings of doing right and giving everyone a second chance. World where the anime sets in all of the ""Demon Slayers"" just slay demons because they are meant to do so, but Tanjiro the main protagonist can see/smell the grief and sorrow of the demons who actually regret and just wanted to be recognized/that regret their choices.\n\nMy favourite character is Inosuke, for his ""goofy"" attitude but still genuine.

Leenbow,"b'\n                Animation, art and sound in this anime are outstanding.\nSame can\'t be said about story or characters.\n\nTalking about characters:\n\n1) Tanjirou - the main hero - the ultimate case of ""Mary Sue"". Increadibly perfect and boring character: brave, strong, good. Speaks in generic style, easily triggers by any kind of evil (his mind turnes off). Has no real weaknesses (outside from ""being too good"")\n   He trains for about two years (almost nothing from his training gots actually shown) and from zero becomes powerfull swordsman. He bravely charges into every battle while knowing nothing about his enemies, magically survives and then always pulls some sort of\n                  ...\n          power trick to win the fight.\n\n2) Zenitsu - secondary hero - wimpy character to the point of absurd. He is constantly afraid of everything, constantly cries about something. Also, he is INCREADIBLY LOUD, shouting different kind of nonsence. Those his traits show up all the time, making Zenitsu increadibly hard character to endure - at least for me.\n   He made his moves twice in entire show - and both times he was fighting, while being asleep. Fainted out of fear and then fighted... I can\'t even add those actions to his account. It\'s like his body fought, not actually Zenitsu. Sadly, body is not a character\n   On an upside: Zenitsu is kind and has weaknesses to overcome. Too bad those weaknesses owerwhelm him entirely \n\n3) Inosuke - secondary hero - stupid character. Considered to be strong, yet loses to Tanjirou in the direct and simple fight. Generally, does almost nothing usefull in the entire show. Inosuke killed one demon when made his appearance - that\'s all. Oh, and once he used his technique too find an enemy in the forest. Now that\'s all.\nInosuke was like worse version of Tanjirou - he always charged into battles because of fighting lust, but actually didn\'t won in any.\n   On an upside: Inosuke was somewhat funny (bacause of his blunt attitude). Brought fun to this otherwise boring show. Yet, even in ""Jester"" role he seems mediocre.\n\n4) Nezuko - can\'t say too much about her, for the most part of the show she was either sleeping either... standing silently, i guess. Nezuko has almost no personality. All i can say - she was kind and remained kind in this weird state of hers. She supports Tanjirou, yet shows almost no emotion to other characters. Cute. But boring.\n\nTalking about story:\n\n   It is linear and predictable. Also, scenario repeats itself one episode after another: strong demon appears - Tanjirou charges - demon dies. Most of the quests heroes received from talking crows - crow say ""do this and this"" - hero does. Why they trust those crows so easily? How heroes recieve payment? Why everybody has to pass such stupid test in order to become a demon slayer? (i mean, most of contestants die, it is just ridiculous). Too many questions were left without an answer\n   The main villain of the show has interesting design, but only on the outside. On the inside - it is generic cruel villain, who tortures his minions for failures. He had a good opportunity to kill the main hero himself - yet he gived this task to his pawns\n   \n   All in all, There were way too many holes in logic, story, worldbuilding... Characters were annoying. I couldn\'t fully enjoy the show, most of the things felt stupid and unreal\n   Art and music are great, but they don\'t justify poor writing.\n\n   I am greatly surprised this show gathers such big scores. Ratings and friend\'s reccomendation were the reasons for me to watch Demon slayer. I became dissapointed as a result\n\n   Similar shows I actually enjoyed: My hero academia, Assasination classroom. Those are far from being perfect too, yet they had nice characters and more convincing world settings\n              '",Demon Slayer
Tech_M,"b""\n                A very typical, generic, and average anime with pretty bland and very stereotypical, trope-y, one-note characters that happen to have some very beautiful (though not mind-blowing) animation. \n\nThere are some interesting fights with some tact that were definitely enjoyable, but the characters won't shut up because they have to remind you of their singular character trait every second. That's not to say all the characters are bad, just that the main protagonists range from average to bad (although I would say they aren't worse than the average anime, in that the average anime has bad characters). \n\nThe main four characters' personalities can almost entirely be\n                  ...\n          described as: lawful good/goodie two shoes; mute-shy girl (which also almost describes two other characters); cowardly, whiny/annoying, and obsessed with girls; and dumb, angry, loud man who tries to fight everything. \n\nWeak characters aren't always an issue in anime, however, this one doesn't do a good job of anything that could remedy it or consistently distract you from the issue. However, I don't think that necessarily brings this anime down a lot, it very much depends on your tolerance for this kind of thing. Personally, I didn't mind it too much, aside from one of the main characters, the whiny and annoying one for the very fact that he was whiny and annoying.\n\nThe sound design is good but nothing to write home about, but it is none the less good. The OP is pretty decent. \n\nOverall, I would say this is definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it and have run out of things to do. It's the kind of thing you would while doing something else, though that would have you not pay as much attention to the animation which is the best part of it, and having to read subtitles would limit the things you could do while watching it.\n              """,Demon Slayer

You guys should just shut up and go back to watching Naruto or Dragon Ball Z or whatever crappy shounen show you wanna watch.\n\nDemon Slayer is amazing. The art style is beautiful, the character designs are wild and spontaneous and blow my mind from how amazing they look. The concept and design adds a new twist to the genre in general. The voice actors are amazing and very skilled at what they do, and they are carefully selected from an overflowing ocean of voices. I applaud the creators of this show for making such a\n                  ...\n          wonderful anime.\n\n10/10 would binge watch again\n              '",Demon Slayer
Dr_Civilization,"b""\n                Demon Slayer is a show about slaying demons. But when the MC, a son of a shrine priest, returns to his home to find his family slaughtered and his sister turned into a demon, what will he do? Join him as he seeks to find a cure for his sister and bring an end to the evil demons that plague society while simultaneously proving to his demon-hunting superiors that his demonic sister is not a threat to them all. Episodes consist of epic, high-stakes, over-the-top fights with top-notch stylistic animations, with episodes of training and character development sprinkled in, making for a great balance.\n\nThis anime\n                  ...\n          is by far the most critically acclaimed anime of 2019 and any anime fan worth their salt should give it a shot. It also has normally excellent animations and adds an over-the-top stylistic element to it in order to enunciate the fight scenes. It can feel a bit slow during training episodes after fights, but that's simply because the fights are so good that the rest of the show pales in comparison. \n\nIf you like fights, flowing top-quality animation, or samurai then this is for you! A liking of comedy is also ideal, as there are myriad laughs interspersed as well.\n\nAs someone who has read the manga I am looking forward to the future seasons as well and have high hopes for the future of this series.\n              """,Demon Slayer
bbyfno,"b""\n                Demon Slayer is incredible. A great sibling duo, the story feel genuine and real. The art is great. I'm reading the manga to catch up and there it's wonderful to see, actual eye candy.\n\nThe OP is like no other, giving this anime an incredible feel and fuels you up for the fights, and the fights are done spectacularly in both animation and sound design of the movements and effects. Excellent!\n\nI can't wait for more chapters to be adapted and the see what they're gonna do for season 2.  This season is a great debut for the series and its definitely going to be a\n                  ...\n          shounen engraved in time for this generation.\n              """,Demon Slayer
6kaotaku9,"b'\n                I\'m not sure how to start this but I\'ll just give my scores, summarise the first episode then explain why I gave the scores that I did.\nStory: 5\nArt: 8 \nSound: 7\nCharacter: 5\nEnjoyment: 4\nOverall: 3\n\nYou can skip the next three paragraphs if you don\'t want to read the summary.\nI\'ll start off by talking about the story, I won\'t go into too much detail since I like to keep my reviews short also sorry if anything is a little off, I started Demon Slayer a while ago and only finished it recently.\nBasically the first episode starts off with Tanjiro trekking through a forest carrying his younger sister,\n                  ...\n          Nezuko, it then flashes back to before where Tanjiro is about to leave his family and to go to the town, there\'s some useless dialect between him and his siblings (and his mother I think) he then leaves to town as his family waves him goodbye (he then just has a useless conversation with Nezuko it\'s not that important), forgot to mention earlier but Tanjiro has a really keen sense of smell. \n\nI think he goes to town to sell charcoal or something, anyway skip a few hours and he\'s walking home but he\'s stopped by a man telling him that the mountain is too dangerous to go up at night, he goes inside to eat dinner and sleep at the strangers house (I refer to him as ""the stranger"" because I can\'t remember his name)they talk about demons and demon slayers or something I don\'t really know. The next morning he leaves the mans house to hike up the mountain back to his own house, as I mentioned before he has a strong sense of smell and can smell blood so he immediately starts to run, he makes it back to his home to see that his family has been slaughtered by demons the only survivor being Nezuko, then we\'re back to where we started, Tanjiro trekking up the mountain carrying his younger sister, we then find out that Nezuko has been turned into a demon.\n\nHim and his sister fall off a mountain or something and are saved by the snow and Nezuko tries kill Tanjiro because why not? Tanjiro shouts some random crap and then Nezuko starts crying and then some guy just comes out of nowhere and tries to kill Nezuko I think, but ends up slicing off Tanjiro\'s ponytail. That one guy that came out of nowhere grabs Nezuko and is about to decapitate her and Tanjiro begs him not to (I\'m getting really lazy now, sorry about this I\'ve been writing for a while) Nezuko doesn\'t get decapitated, Tanjiro gets knocked out by something, Nezuko defends Tanjiro and then gets hit in the face. Tanjiro wakes up and sees Nezuko lying next to him with a nuzzle in her mouth. He is told to to go up a mountain and find some old man, they dig graves for their family and then go to find previously mentioned old man and then the episode ends.\n \nAnyway that was my lazy summary of the first episode so now I\'ll just talk about why I scored this show with what I did.\n\nThe story: The story is mediocre, it\'s not bad but it\'s nothing special either, the concept of slaying demons in anime has already been done, but a show doesn\'t really have to be original just to be good, it just needs to be well done, but for me it didn\'t really hit that mark. The writing for the show is average at most, however I am able to see why other people can enjoy it.\n\nArt: Although the artstyle isn\'t something I\'d like personally (which put me off slightly) it is a nice artstyle, it just looks a little rough compared to what I would usually like, I might have actually scored the show lower than I did if it weren\'t for the animation/ art.\n\nCharacters: The characters for me were just bland and annoying which kind of put me off, they are fairly cliche, Tanjiro for example is just your average, kind and caring shounen protagonist, it\'s not that I want the main character of a show to be a d*** but these types of characters are just too nice so much to the point where it annoys me.\n\nNezuko doesn\'t even seem to have a purpose except sitting in a basket and looking cute, the entire show it feels like she\'s incapable of doing anything herself except relying on Tanjiro, not much else to it, I just dislike characters that don\'t do anything for themselves.\n\nZenitsu is just the average pervert that they threw in because why not? Inosuke is just the character that tries to pick fights for no reason, he\'s an ok character but not the type I like, they kind of remind of Bakugo and Mineta from mha \n\nEnjoyment: I honestly found myself procrastinating when it came to watching an episode of this, it was just really boring for me, I started Demon Slayer last year and wasn\'t enjoying it so I asked some people if it starts to pick up and they said to give it 10 episodes, yeah I ended up dropping it, I have finished it now but I was pretty bored and disappointed by the end, not much else to it I just didn\'t enjoy this show :/\n\nOverall I give it a 3, it\'s probably one of the most overhyped shows I\'ve watched, it\'s basically just every shounen trope imaginable, not really much else too say I just didn\'t enjoy this show, but yeah that concludes what I had to say about Demon Slayer, sorry if I sounded unsure of myself with this review but I don\'t really remember much so I was kind of nervous about getting something wrong.\n              '",Demon Slayer
ssylvi,"b""\n                I really wasn't expecting Demon Slayer to be this childish.\nCan't believe this is what everyone's been praising this whole time..it's just forgettable and boring really.\n\nAround episode 10 and especially 11 it was absolutely unwatchable because of how focused the episodes were on that blonde kids exaggerated and so-not-funny fear of literally everything. Someone asked him why he carries a sword if he can't use it and that's exactly what I'm wondering as well. \nI hope he actually proves to be a good character in the future because I can't stand absurd characters like these. I had to take 3 breaks just to finish 1 episode\n                  ...\n          because of this guy. Other than that, the humor is absolutely awful and hasn't made me even smile once. \nI feel like I'm being too generous with my rating but it's only because I want to keep watching it and see how bad it gets.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Tiarwa,"b""\n                all i can say. beautiful but bland. \n\nI genuinely did not find anything interesting about Tanjiro as the protagonist. The side characters range from hilarious (Inosuke) to legitimately interesting (Nezuko) to downright annoying (Zenitsu). Those are the only saving graces for the characters as I don't remember any others, even the villains. Some have interesting design choices and I give credit for that but damn are they dull.\n\nThe animation and art style is the obvious highlight of the show. Its downright breathtaking. Its a shame a really cookie cutter show with a cast of mostly bland characters holds it back from its full potential.\n              """,Demon Slayer
Rhetorical_Locus,"b""\n                I initially avoided Demon Slayer believing it to be just another shonen battle manga with a protagonist that possessed a heart of gold and an indominable drive to succeeded that we have come to associate with shonen protagonists. However, when I noticed that the studio in charge was the legendary Ufotable I decided to give it a shot. After 22 episodes in I can glad say that I was wrong and that this anime is a gem.\n\n\nStory\nAlthough the story begins in an unoriginal manner it does serve its purpose well as a means to provide the protagonist with goal worth risking his life for. The\n                  ...\n          story gradually blooms into something beautiful that manages to capture joy, sadness, despair, desperation, and laughter quite brilliantly. The world of Demon Slayer and its people isn't black and white, there is a strong theme of broken happiness and tragedy begetting even more tragedy. Once the story gets going it hooks you into its world and makes you care about the its characters. \n \nAnimation\nKnowing that studio Ufotable was in charge I began this anime with high expectations and was not disappointed. In fact they exceded my expectations. Utilizing 2D animation, CGI, and even rotoscoping, Ufotable have show cased the skills of their talented staff members brilliantly.\n\nSound\nWith the legendary Yuki Kajiura and Go Shiina at the helm, the OST was simply awe inspring. Furthermore, the sound effects utilized in the show were amazing and served their purpose brilliantly to get you invested into Demon Slayer's world, characters, and battles. Additionally the voice actors of Demon Slayer manage to brilliantly capture the character's emotions. Quite frankly I cant find anything wrong with the sound design even if I try its just that good.\n\nCharacters\nEven with its jaw dropping animation, brilliant sound, and talented voice actors (Japenese), I would have dropped the show early on if I thought the protagonist was nothing special. However, I can safely say that the protagonist, Tanjiro Komado, is a joy to watch on screen. His commpasionate nature really shines through in a manner that really made me feel like he was a genuinally likeable person. Shonen protagonists in general are usually presented as immensely kind and lovable idiots; however, Tanjiro is special. Special in that his kindness shines through and feels genuine in a manner that other series just have not been able to capture, at least for me. All the other characters are great as well and bounce brilliantly off of Tanjiro's personality. In summary, the characters in Demon Slayer are endearing and likeable. \n\n\nIn all my years watching anime and reading manga this show has managed to strike a chord with me that only very few shows have. If you are still unsure whether to watch this show or not, I say give the protagonist a chance to win your heart. I can't promise that he will be able to but I won't be suprised if he does.\n              """,Demon Slayer

hazer324,"b'\n                Before i even started watching demon slayer i was told that it was incredible and it was an incredible anime eager to check out the hype for it i started watching it and after 15 episodes i have never been so disappointing and board in my entire life an unfortunately its just another generic shonen thats been over hyped and put on a gigantic pedestal for some reason and I\'m genuinely  confused as to why people like it so much  \n\ncharacters 2/10\n\nall of the characters in the show are bland an un-original, theres no substance to their characters apart from look at me\n                  ...\n          i can scream stuff and it will magically make me strong and funny. The main character i cant even remember his name hes that forgettable, his personality is bland and filled with contradictions thats almost laughable and the only time he gets strong in this anime is through screaming random moves he just came up with that magically work which is with him saying something cringey like ""i must save my sister so i will fight"" which is extremely boring and predictable. the other side characters are just annoying and their personalities are all frustratingly bad.\n\nStory 3/10\n\nThe story starts off with the main characters family being killed apart from his sister who is still alive but hes motivated to cure her (how interesting) and for some reason he doesn\'t seem to care much that they are all dead apart from a brief scene were hes sad despite all this he forgets his family is dead and only cares about fixing his sister which is a bit odd but whatever. But the real problem begins as he wants to train to become a demon slayer in order to avenge his family and put an end to this ruthless race that\'s plaguing his region so he trains with an old man that teaches him how to fight and yes we do see a a fair amount of training hes goes through however  it suddenly decides to jump forwards in the future without giving us any information and hes magically able to cut a stupid rock. after this he gets a contract to kills a few demons he fights them all boring fights that are predictable and nothing original is able to come out the story. I basically forced myself to keep watching and i regret, finally after 15 episodes i just didn\'t care anymore and stopped watching it.\n\nanimation 8/10\n\nas much as i dislike about this anime i do however love the animation and overall art style that this anime has this doesn\'t automatically make it good though in order for the animation to be impact on me i need to relate and have emotional connection to the context of whats happening which demon slayer does not provide because everything is predictable and the characters are lifeless despite this its very smooth but has wasted potential on this shitty anime.\n\noverall dont watch it\n              '",Demon Slayer
